[{"content":"Quest for Glory 1 is one of my favorite role-playing games, and one of the first I played. Sierra walked the line between adventure and puzzle games beautifully in the series, making something that still feels somewhat unique. Ultimately, though, what keeps bringing me back is the setting and the story, told with impressive graphics, great music, and witty dialog that still hold up well so many years later.\nI recently came back to play it again. You can find it on GOG, seven megabyte monster that it is. I highly recommend playing with the excellent Gamer Walkthrough for it and a map, which are great for hitting the highlights quickly and helping you past the more subtle puzzles.\nEven ten playthroughs in, walking out of town into the forest and hearing Hero\u0026rsquo;s March gives me that feeling of nervous excitement and imminent adventure.\nThe beautiful art has permanently established this setting - castles, forest, waterfalls, mountains - as the definitive role playing setting for me. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until Fallout 3, many years later, that I found a setting outside this stereotype that could evoke a similar level of immersion and wonder in me.\nOh, man, the seedy tavern theme and the Thieves Guild. It really feels like your choice of player class provides a lot of unique gameplay.\nAnd, of course, Erana\u0026rsquo;s Peace. It\u0026rsquo;s viscerally calming to walk into this grove in the middle of the night, running from monsters that are much too powerful for you. I think some of my adulthood hiking and camping adventures are really about trying to find a place like this in the real world. =)\nLike all games, not everything in Quest for Glory is great. Puzzles, as noted earlier, can be quite hard if you haven\u0026rsquo;t talked to the right other person. Magic is hard to use quickly and you rapidly run out of mana and stamina, so resting or potions are important to keep handy. The combat is frustrating as the frame rates are very low and so it\u0026rsquo;s quite hard to see when monsters are about to hit you in time to dodge. Here\u0026rsquo;s me about to get clocked\u0026hellip;\nStill, I\u0026rsquo;m amazed at how much I enjoy this game so many years later. I think it was released at just the right moment, when VGA graphics, SoundBlaster sound, and mouse interaction made games drastically more playable and immersive than they were just a few years earlier.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t a walkthrough, but I can\u0026rsquo;t help but leave a few tips:\n Sleep in Erana\u0026rsquo;s Peace - full healing, fruit to eat, and flowers to sell. Play the daggers game with the Chief Thief to quickly earn money. Work in the stables and practice with the Weapon Master to quickly improve your skills. Practice lockpicking safely at the Healer\u0026rsquo;s Hut (even in the daytime!) Battle the Goblins in their camp to finish training combat skills. Keep a few potions handy - running out of stamina can easily lead to death.  I took too many screenshots for one post, but you can find the full set here. In DOSBox, use Ctrl+F5 to get perfect native resolution screenshots, and ImageMagick -scale 400% to make pixel-perfect scaled versions. =)\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/gaming/2021/04/20/quest-for-glory-i/","summary":"Quest for Glory 1 is one of my favorite role-playing games, and one of the first I played.

What should you do with the money?\n  Credit Card debt Emergency Fund (one month of expenses) Other Non-Mortgage Debt (car loan, student loans) Some Retirement Saving (get employer match) Future Big Purchases (house, trip, car, kid college) More Retirement Saving Audacious Goals: House Payoff, Early Retirement, Year off from Work, \u0026hellip;   First, if you have any credit card debt, pay it off. Put the credit cards away so you stop using them. Pay with a debit card instead. I know, debit cards don\u0026rsquo;t have rewards and fraud protection. But if you\u0026rsquo;re in debt, stopping the bank from taking your money every month in interest matters much more than the value of credit card rewards and the potential risk of losing some to fraud.\nOnce your credit cards are paid off, the interest you were paying is now free for other saving. If your \u0026ldquo;monthly bills\u0026rdquo; account included minimum credit card payments, that money can go to other goals now. Since \u0026ldquo;monthly bills\u0026rdquo; aren\u0026rsquo;t paid from your day-to-day checking account, the new savings won\u0026rsquo;t disappear into other spending.\nNext, start building up an emergency fund. Even if your month-to-month spending is manageable, surprises and emergencies will happen. Maybe your car breaks down, your roof starts leaking, or you get injured and have medical costs to cover. Your goal is to save up money to handle these kinds of situations without getting back into credit card debt. Having just one month of expenses saved up provides a huge boost to peace of mind, knowing that you can handle a surprise bill or manage if you lose your job without immediate disaster. Make sure to keep your new emergency money in a bank account you can easily access, because the point of the money is to be available instantly when you need it.\nAfter you\u0026rsquo;ve saved one month of expenses, I would suggest shifting most, but not all, of your saving to your next goals. Many people recommend saving six months of expenses in emergency money, but that takes a very long time and money set aside for later goals can often be repurposed as emergency money if needed.\nWith credit card debt gone and an emergency fund, it\u0026rsquo;s time to wipe out your other non-mortgage debt. If you have car loan or student loan, start allocating some of your money to pay those down. Once you pay off your current car, put your car payment money toward other debt, then accumulate it so that you can buy your next car without a loan.\nNow that any debt other than your house is out of the way, it\u0026rsquo;s a good time to start some retirement savings. If your job offers a 401(k), saving money for retirement will reduce your taxes. Many companies also offer to match some of your savings, providing a huge boost. Try to save enough to maximize any matches, or about 5% of your income even if there aren\u0026rsquo;t any matches available.\nAlong with some initial retirement savings, you can start thinking about future big purchases. If you know you\u0026rsquo;ll want to buy a house, pay for college for kids, take a big trip, buy a fancier car, or make another big purchase in the next few years, start saving for those goals. Retirement saving is important for your future, but the point of saving is to help your present as well. Having some big spending goals you can achieve makes the benefits of saving feel a lot more real.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve paid off all of your debt, are making steady progress toward any big purchases, and still have money left, congratulations! It\u0026rsquo;s a great feeling. At this point you can work toward some truly audacious goals like early retirement, paying off your house, saving for a year off from work, and other things that most people aren\u0026rsquo;t able to do. If you ramp up retirement savings, take the time to estimate how much you\u0026rsquo;ll need for retirement. (More on that in a future topic). Retirement savings have no tangible, day-to-day benefit, so calculating how much your extra saving will increase your future lifestyle or allow you to retire sooner is really important to help keep you motivated.\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/04/13/what-to-save-for/","summary":"So you\u0026rsquo;ve made a budget and now you\u0026rsquo;re starting to save.

I\u0026rsquo;m not willing to buy coffee out every day, so I learned to make cold brew at home and mix reasonable replicas of my Seattle\u0026rsquo;s Best iced mocha and the Vanilla Sweet Cream between coffee outings.\nHome cold brew is great, but it\u0026rsquo;s annoying to make and easy to end up with a sour or bitter batch.\nNot long ago, I learned that Starbucks provides free refills. Buy any drink with the app, then bring the cup back to the counter to get a free refill of drip coffee, tea, or plain cold brew. I can\u0026rsquo;t drink a second cold brew without shaking, but then I realized I could bring it home instead.\nNow I buy coffee out twice a week, and bring home a no-ice plain cold brew refill each time to make my home drinks for the other five days of the week.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried basically every grocery store cold brew available, including the Starbucks carafes, cans, and pitcher brew-bags, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never found any at home option as good or consistent as the cold brew from the Starbucks cafes.\nWith the refills, I get the best cold brew I can find, never have to brew at home, and don\u0026rsquo;t pay any more than the two coffee outings I\u0026rsquo;m going to do anyway.

We want the full $4,000 benefit from the two child tax credits, which are not fully refundable, which means at least $61,725 in ordinary income ($25,100 standard deduction + $19,750 x 10% + $16,875 x 12% = $4,000 tax). After that, another $44,425 of qualified income (qualified dividends or long term capital gains) are also tax free.\nHowever, our maximum tax free income of $106,150 goes over the income where ACA subsidies disappear, which is $104,800 (400% of the Federal Poverty Level or FPL).\nWith our taxable account interest and dividends, we can Roth convert about $52,000 per year with no tax cost other than a reduced ACA subsidy, which is effectively a 9.83% tax and a good deal to us.\nHowever, after reading an excellent summary of the American Rescue Plan, I found out that things will be a lot different for 2021 and 2022.\nFirst, the child tax credit is fully refundable, so we no longer need a particular minimum income to fully use the child tax credit.\nSecond, the ACA Premium Assistance Tax Credit (PATC, or \u0026ldquo;ACA subsidy\u0026rdquo; below) will be larger for 2021 and 2022. There\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;premium percentage\u0026rdquo; of your income that ACA expects you to pay for health care, but then the subsidy covers the rest of the cost of your local \u0026ldquo;benchmark plan\u0026rdquo;. These premium percentages are much lower for 2021 and 2022 at a wide range of income levels. Using the 2020 Federal Poverty Levels:\n   Income [% of FPL] Income [Family of 4] 2021-2022 Premium Percentage \u0026lsquo;Normal\u0026rsquo; Premium Percentage     \u0026lt; 133% \u0026lt; $34,846 0.00% 2.07%   133% $34,846 0.00% 3.10%   150% $39,300 0.00% 4.14%   200% $52,400 2.00% 6.52%   250% $65,500 4.00% 8.33%   300% $78,600 6.00% 9.83%   350% $91,700 7.25% 9.83%   400% $104,800 8.50% 9.83%   \u0026gt; 400% \u0026gt; $104,800 8.50% N/A (no subsidy)    Together, these two changes mean that a much lower target income is best, because we aren\u0026rsquo;t losing part of the child tax credit and the ACA subsidy decreases much more quickly as our income increases, acting like a higher marginal tax than normal.\nIn our case, it looks like our income for the next two years should be about $72,000 (275% of FPL), which is the maximum income at which our (bronze plan) ACA premiums are fully reimbursed.\nThis will mean doing a $22,000 smaller Roth conversion. Normally that would only save us $2,162 in ACA subsidies (9.83%), in which case we\u0026rsquo;d rather stick with the bigger Roth conversion. For 2021 and 2022, however, it\u0026rsquo;ll save $2,640 in federal tax (we\u0026rsquo;re not losing any child tax credit) and a stonking $5,600 in ACA subsidies, for a total of $8,240, almost four times the normal benefit.\nIf you receive the child tax credit, buy healthcare from the ACA exchanges, and have control over your taxable income, it\u0026rsquo;s worth looking to see if you should have a different plan for this year and next.\nA few more notes for 2021 and 2022:\n Stimulus checks are officially based on 2021 income, but will be sent based on your latest taxes filed when the IRS initially processes the payments. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to pay them back if your 2019 or 2020 taxes triggered a higher payment than your 2021 income would qualify for. You may want to delay filing taxes if your 2019 income was lower than 2020. Watch out for the $150,000 income level (MFJ) because any stimulus payment and the extra child tax credit very rapidly phase out. The ACA PATC is not limited to incomes under 400% of FPL, though your subsidy shrinks as you\u0026rsquo;re expected to pay 8.5% of your income toward the benchmark healthcare plan. There are also dependent care account, COBRA, unemployment assistance, and tuition debt  ","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/04/12/the-american-rescue-plan-aca-and-roth-conversions/","summary":"The American Rescue Plan became law on March 11th, 2021, and I was surprised to figure out that it changes the taxable income we want to aim for in 2021 and 2022 significantly.","title":"The American Rescue Plan, ACA, and Roth conversions"},{"content":"When we got our first real jobs, we put our paychecks into our checking account and bought everything from there. It couldn\u0026rsquo;t be easier, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure many people do the same thing. The problem was that while we didn\u0026rsquo;t spend more than we had, we also weren\u0026rsquo;t saving up anything. When we wanted to take a vacation, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear how we would pay for it. When we had an unexpected expense (a gift for someone, a car repair, or whatever) our account would be knocked down and we\u0026rsquo;d have to cut back for a while to try to refill it. It felt like we were constantly being knocked off track and forced to make cuts.\nThis went on until we decided we wanted to buy a house and realized we needed to save up a down payment. At the time we couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine saving up so much money. We read some articles about budgeting and tried tracking all of our expenses, but it felt like too much work. What we really wanted was a way to control our spending and do some saving without a lot of effort or a lot of compromises.\nEventually, we settled on the idea of having multiple accounts (doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound simple, does it?) and have stuck with that system ever since. First, we put our paychecks into a transfer account instead of our checking account, so that we could split up the money for different goals. Then, in addition to our checking account for day-to-day use, we opened a new account for our monthly bills, one for irregular spending, and one for each savings goal (next car, house down payment, vacations).\nWe added up our monthly bills and transferred the total to the bills account each month. Now we don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about the power bill knocking us off track. We added up our \u0026ldquo;day-to-day\u0026rdquo; purchases going back a month or two and transferred that amount to our checking account, so we weren\u0026rsquo;t really cutting back spending overall. We set aside a little big for each goal and put the rest in \u0026ldquo;irregular spending\u0026rdquo;.\nWhile simple, this change really helped. Our monthly bills didn\u0026rsquo;t catch us off guard anymore! We were automatically saving for irregular expenses, so we often could pay for them without transferring money from anywhere else. We could just look at the day-to-day account to decide how much to spend. If we wanted to eat out and the balance looked good, we could go for something fancier. If the balance was low, hot dogs at Costco or stay home. At first we didn\u0026rsquo;t allocate much to our other savings goals, but even a little was much better than nothing. Similarly, when deciding to take a vacation or looking at our next car, we again had one account balance to check to decide what we should spend.\nWhen we got our next raises, we found another benefit - the extra money accumulated in our transfer account instead of disappearing into new spending. We could intentionally allocate it, and we chose to save most of it for goals instead of automatically spending it all day-to-day. When we got our bonuses, we saved them rather than watching them melt in our checking account. When we found cheaper phone plans, the money was saved instead of vanishing elsewhere. This turned out to be the most important thing we did - saving most of our raises each year dramatically increased our savings rate over time.\nSo, that\u0026rsquo;s the process. No tracking every purchase, no spreadsheets, no budget software. Just separate accounts, automatic transfers, and one balance to check for any given spending decision.\nOne bonus trick: Our day-to-day account used to sometimes be a low on grocery day, and it felt bad to scrimp on groceries or gas to stay on budget. We shifted our day-to-day account transfers from bi-monthly (when our paychecks came) to weekly on Fridays. This means Friday night dinner and groceries and gas on Saturday are now always right after \u0026ldquo;payday\u0026rdquo;, and any cutting happens to Amazon purchases and lunches out midweek instead.\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/03/30/how-we-budget/","summary":"When we got our first real jobs, we put our paychecks into our checking account and bought everything from there.

The walkthroughs online had some skippable steps and I ran into some problems, and then I got distracted optimizing it.. Anyway, here are my terse, working steps for getting very nice Win95 DOSBox images.\nIn addition to a Win95 CD ISO and key, you\u0026rsquo;ll need:\n Empty FAT-16 HDD images S3 Video Driver DOS 6.22 Boot Disk  I\u0026rsquo;ve also packed up all of my DOSBox scripting, if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to copy and paste it from here.\nRecommendations Use Win95C (OSR 2.5) I saw the fewest unhandled exceptions and other problems with the last Win95 release.\nTrim the Win95 install CD You can delete all of the files on the Win95C CD which aren\u0026rsquo;t on the Win95A CD to get the latest Win95 fixes, but without all of the optional software (IE, AOL, \u0026hellip;). This also eliminated a few exceptions during the first boot. My scripting in Step 1 below copies the correct file list.\nMake a Win95 install CD hard drive I couldn\u0026rsquo;t mount the Win95 ISO so a DOS boot disk would see it. The walkthroughs copy the install directory to the target hard drive, but that means the target drive must be larger. Instead, I copied my (trimmed) Win95 setup folder to an empty hard drive image and then mount it along with the DOS Boot Disk and target drive to start setup.\nMount a second hard drive for each game You have to boot from an \u0026ldquo;img\u0026rdquo; file in DOSBox to run Win95, but IMG files take up the whole drive size, not just the used space. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to installing all of my games in the same Win95 image, which I could break easily, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want a huge Win95 starting image to install each game. Instead, you can leave the Win95 image small and mount a second empty drive for each game that\u0026rsquo;s the right size to install the game to.\nDOSBox.conf Template This is the DOSBox.conf template I used for each step below.

As long as you get the installs right and make backups of the images, you\u0026rsquo;re done.\nHowever, in a past life I automated more modern Win95 setups, so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but look into how Win95 installs are automated.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a tool on the Win95C CD in admin\\nettools\\bsetup called batch which will ask you for the answers to most questions setup.exe asks, and then write out a BSETUP.INF file you can use to automate. Pass this as an argument to setup.exe, and you\u0026rsquo;ve got an automated install:\nD:\\Win95\\setup.exe /im /is /IW D:\\Win95\\BSETUP.INF Here is the one I ended up with. I figured out everything except how to get it to look for a sound card, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to leave it fully automated (and, it got stuck on the exception setting up the Control Panel also).

My retail-heavy-attempt was straightforward and didn\u0026rsquo;t take too many floors, but I thought it\u0026rsquo;d be fun to try to build consistently all the way up to the 100th floor cathedral, and to try to max out many of the in-game limits right when I reached it.\nDesign My first realization was that I\u0026rsquo;d have to have a narrower tower in order to build all the way up. In my previous attempt, I\u0026rsquo;d only built 18 retail floors and I was nearly at the limit of commercial facilities (512), escalators, and elevators.\nIf I want to build all the way to the 100th floor, I have to keep to one escalator per floor. This means a maximum width of about 19 offices, or 19 x 9 = 171 segments. I want to make all-one-thing floors this time to keep the design more simple, so a width which has an even number of offices, retail shops, fast food, or twin hotel rooms would be nice.\nI settled on a width of 144 segments - 16 offices, 12 retail shops, 9 fast food, or 24 twin suites.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve got 7 lobbies to fill (1, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90). I have 64 escalators, so I can place 9 per lobby (though I think Sims will only accept 7). I\u0026rsquo;ll have to keep to three elevator shafts per lobby, so one express elevator and two normal shafts. This leaves me with three more shafts for service elevators. With a limit of 512 commercial spaces, that\u0026rsquo;s a bit over 73 per lobby. If I use a 144-width-tower, this works nicely as four floors of fast food and three floors of shops, for 72 facilities.\nI want offices throughout this time, but with only two elevator shafts I\u0026rsquo;ll need them to be on escalators to avoid overwhelming my elevators. Since I have to keep my fast food and retail shops within four levels of the lobby, I only have one floor left for offices.\nAnd in the empty floors I can\u0026rsquo;t reach from escalators and in excess of my seven retail floors, I\u0026rsquo;ll put hotel - high income and low traffic.\nEach full 144-width hotel floor has 24 twin rooms. The bottom floor of each batch has two housekeeping, three suites, and 14 twin rooms.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get to it!\nLobby Layout Here\u0026rsquo;s the basic template for each lobby:\n   Floors Facilities Pop $/Qtr [K]     20-25 6x Hotel 274 $1,260   17-19 3x Retail Shop 900 $540   16 Office 96 $160   15 Lobby     11-14 4x Fast Food 1,260 $324    So this is six hotel floors, four fast food, three retail shop, and one office. I kept two office floors above the first lobby, and B1 is parking, so there are only three fast food and two shop floors on the bottom lobby. The 90th floor lobby only has five hotel floors, since F100 is for the cathedral.\nSave - Offices and $60M\nSave - Just Before Cathedral\nTribulations This layout went up relatively smoothly, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t completely without problems. The elevators must be very carefully placed to get all of the shafts within the 144 width - the service elevators had to be at the outermost edges, and I had to rebuild the local elevators a few segments out from their original placement to fit all six express elevators with enough spacing.\nNext, I eventually needed 10 Recycling Centers, so I had to bump the main lobby out to a width of 150 to fit them across with room for the Metro Station. (Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to put the escalators to the Metro Station in before putting the Recycling Centers back!)\nFinally, my topmost Retail Shop floor, floor 94, couldn\u0026rsquo;t maintain enough traffic. Three floors of retail worked on the other lobbies, and no other facilities had bad reviews on the 90th floor lobby. I decided to replace the shops with restaurants, which didn\u0026rsquo;t have any problems and still kept my weekday population over 15,000.\nResult After a long night of building, I finally got it all done - it\u0026rsquo;s a monster! I\u0026rsquo;m using all 24 elevator shafts, 59 out of 64 escalators, and 477 of the 512 commercial facility limit. The population peaks at 21,643 on the first weekday evening (counting weekend retail traffic and with the hotel rooms filled), and still manages a 15,527 weekday minimum.\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/gaming/2021/03/17/simtower-max-tower/","summary":"A few days after my previous SimTower adventure, I wanted to revise my tower design.

At normal population, Fast Food income is $3k/day ($9k/qtr) and restaurants make $6k/day ($18k/qtr). Fast Food income is $3k per day with 40-48 customers, or $9k/qtr.

It turns out that you can build escalators on empty floors, so just bulldoze the offices right behind the stairs, then replace the stairs with an escalator, and then rebuild the offices. Sims will take a maximum of four flights of stairs, but seven escalators, so you can build out three levels above and four levels below each lobby with escalators.\nWhen does population update? Population is static for offices and condos. Hotel Population goes up and down as guest check in and out. Population for retail locations updates when they open to reflect the number of \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; customers the previous day. For example, if a Fast Food place has 48 customers on the weekend, the tower will count that population from 10am (opening) on the next day (weekday 1) until the opening two days later (weekday 2).\nWhat is the math for fast food population, and how do offices affect them? Fast Food, when newly built, has the following daily traffic: 10, 20, 20, 20, 35, 35, 35, 40, \u0026hellip;. Weekends get 20% extra traffic. Rainy days get about half the normal traffic. Fast Food places normally have 35 weekday customers and 48 weekend customers.\nIf office workers can get to the fast food place, five of the six office workers will visit a Fast Food place within range each weekday. Ideally, this means three offices can boost each Fast Food place to maximum revenue, but the distribution of bonus visitors is uneven, so you are likely to need four offices per fast food. These extra customers boost earnings (slightly), but are not counted again for the tower population, so they don\u0026rsquo;t help you earn a higher star rating.\nHow far away do facilities have to be to avoid noise problems? There must be at least 11 empty segments between the fast food and the office. Hotel rooms require 21 segments from an office. These gaps waste space quickly, so keeping whole floors all one type seems to work better.\nWhich facilities object to noise from one another? Offices object to noise from commercial (fast food, restaurants, retail, cinema). Hotels and Condos object to noise from commercial and offices.\nHow do housekeepers work? Each housekeeping facility has six housekeepers. They will only work on separate floors, so you need multiple housekeeping facilities and a service elevator to get several to clean one floor. Each housekeeper can clean 19 rooms, apparently, but I needed four housekeeping facilities to safely clean my 58 room floors and they didn\u0026rsquo;t finish until after 2:00pm.\nWhat are the best express elevator settings? Each express elevator shaft should only stop at the lobby and a single skylobby, so the cars just go back and forth. Two shafts with all eight cars each can serve each skylobby with the full eight full shopping floors. Configure the express elevators to wait 30 seconds to cause them to fill up more consistently.\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/gaming/2021/03/13/simtower-reference/","summary":"When playing through SimTower again, I was frequently looking for facts from the help and from online walkthroughs. Here\u0026rsquo;s a double-checked, complete set of the details I was looking for when replaying the game, with more useful details together in one place than the original help.","title":"SimTower Reference"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s 1994, and Maxis is a big name in gaming. The excellent SimCity 2000 released last year, but we\u0026rsquo;re looking at a lesser known title, SimTower. SimTower was not actually developed by Maxis, but instead by Yoot Saito, who was inspired by the 1989 SimCity. The game was released as \u0026ldquo;The Tower\u0026rdquo; in Japan and was relatively successful. Maxis learned about the game and offered to publish it in the US, branded as a \u0026ldquo;Sim\u0026rdquo;-title.\n26 years later, I\u0026rsquo;ve been digging up old games and wanted to really beat SimTower this time. Being from 1994, SimTower is actually a Windows 3.1 title, so you have to install Windows on DosBox to run it. I installed Windows 95 to run it, which took a few hours of attempts and ended up being a nostalgic journey itself. I\u0026rsquo;ve written up the steps that worked for me.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my first pass at \u0026ldquo;solving\u0026rdquo; SimTower. I was inspired by a very short and simple SimTower walkthrough, though I ended up using a Retail Store / Fast Food mix for higher income with similar population.\nSee my SimTower Reference for some tables I wish I\u0026rsquo;d had before playing SimTower again, cobbled together from a few different websites and corrected.\nQuick \u0026lsquo;TOWER\u0026rsquo; Walkthrough The map is 375 \u0026ldquo;segments\u0026rdquo; wide, but a 360 segment tower is much easier to fill evenly, so build a 360 segment lobby. Put three floors with 40 offices each on top. Add three stairways to serve them: after the 9th, 20th and 31st offices.\nNow, turn up the simulation speed and save up $60M. For maximum speed, close the Map Window, shrink the Main Window, look at the sky, and turn on \u0026ldquo;Fast Mode\u0026rdquo;. My 2020 laptop finished a quarter every 8 seconds like this, so it was only about a ten minute wait. Here\u0026rsquo;s my saved game, in case you want to skip that.\nNext, build an empty B1. Add matching stairs, two security offices on the left, and 10 Fast Food centered around the middle stairs.\nOnce you get three stars, add an empty 5F, B2, and B3. Replace all stairs with escalators, going all the way from B3 to 5F. You can bulldoze the offices to place escalators there, and then rebuild the offices. On B1, add a Medical Center next to the Security Offices. Under B3, add two Recycling Centers.\nNow we\u0026rsquo;ll add \u0026ldquo;shopping floors\u0026rdquo;, which have 15 Fast Food and 10 Retail Shops each. Make F5, B2, and B3 shopping floors. Wait for a quarter and confirm all of your facilities have a blue eval.\nTime for a small hotel. Add an empty F6. Add four elevator shafts, after office 8, 16, 24, and 32, set to wait 30 seconds before departure. On F6, add four Housekeepings, six suites, and 40 twin rooms. The four elevators should serve all of the rooms efficiently.\nTime for a Skylobby. Add empty floors up to F18. Build the lobby on F15. Add two express elevators will all eight cars each, set to wait 30 seconds, after offices 18 and 22. Build seven shopping floors with escalators on F11-F18. Add three more Recycling Centers on B4.\nBuild a second Skylobby on F30, with the same seven shopping floors from F26-F33, and new express elevators after offices 14 and 26. Make sure each pair of express elevators only stops at one of the Skylobbies. Add another three Recycling Centers on B4. Build a Metro Station on B4 near the right side escalator and add another escalator to connect it to the rest of the tower.\nAlmost done! You need one more shopping floor, but can\u0026rsquo;t build any more escalators. Add four elevator shafts around F15, on top of the hotel ones. Add four cars to each and set them to wait 30 seconds. Connect them to F19 and build your last shopping floor there.\nFinally, you can extend the middle two express elevators to floor 90, build a small Skylobby, build up to floor 100, add a Cathedral, build a two car elevator to get people from 90 to 100, and wait for the wedding.\nSave - Offices and $60M\nSave - Just Got TOWER\nRationale Why this design? Offices are a great source of income, and a two-star tower with stairs has zero expenses. After that, you need a lot of population and you need a reasonable income. Fast Food provides the best population-per-space, but the income is barely enough to cover lobby, express elevator, and escalator maintenance. Retail Shops have only slightly less population, but provide more than twice the income. A balance of 15 Fast Food and 10 Shops keeps your income reasonable and allows you to build 20 floors and 10 more Fast Food before hitting the 512 retail facility limit.\nPutting Security, Medical, and Parking on B1 avoids any elevator transportation and allows you to build only one ramp, with more than enough space left for the 10 Fast Food you need to hit 15,000 weekday population.\nYou only need two hotel suites, but I built a full single floor to generate a little more income while keeping the elevators very simple and avoiding a service elevator.\nTower Layout    Floors Facilities Pop $/Qtr [K]     31-33 Retail Shop x18, Fast Food x9 2,325 $855   30 Skylobby     26-29 Retail Shop x18, Fast Food x9 3,100 $1,140   19-25 Empty     16-18 Retail Shop x18, Fast Food x9 3,100 $1,140   15 Skylobby     11-14 15x Fast Food, 10x Retail Shop 3,100 $1,140   7-10 Empty     6 4x Housekeeping, 6x Hotel Suite, 40x Twin Room 92 $468   5 15x Fast Food, 10x Retail Shop 775 $285   2-4 40x Office 720 $1,200    Lobby     B1 2x Security, Medical, 10x Fast Food, 16x Parking Space, Ramp 350 $90   B2-B3 15x Fast Food, 10x Retail Shop 1,550 $570   B4-B6 8x Recycling Center, Metro Station      Total 15,112 $6,888    ","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/gaming/2021/03/12/return-to-simtower/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s 1994, and Maxis is a big name in gaming.

I live near Seattle. I worked at Microsoft, mostly on Visual Studio and Visual Studio Online. I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about performance and I love to optimize things - code, games, finances, coffee - everything. The optimizing of finances worked out well, and now I\u0026rsquo;m off writing fast code, playing old games, and spending a lot more time with my wife and two girls.\nI\u0026rsquo;d love to see a world where more of the code I run is fast and more people achieve financial independence sooner, and hopefully this blog will help with that.\nYou can reach me via scottlo@outlook.com.\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/about/","summary":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Scott Louvau.
