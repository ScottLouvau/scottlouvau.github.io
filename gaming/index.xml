      <description>Last week on Hacker News, someone announced a new Wordle variant, QWERTLE. As an avid Wordle player and optimizer, I was excited to try playing and solving this new game.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of &amp;ldquo;best first Wordle guesses&amp;rdquo; posts online, but while they may provide the most theoretical information, I had trouble using them as a human.</description>

      <description>I love the tower defense game Kingdom Rush. More than anything else, it has just the right amount of complexity - just enough towers and abilities to give you options, and just enough tactical play to keep you busy between build steps.</description>

      <description>The latest in my series of game replays is Batman: Arkham Asylum, thanks to a recent GOG Sale that had it going for $5.</description>

      <description>Quest for Glory 1 is one of my favorite role-playing games, and one of the first I played. Sierra walked the line between adventure and puzzle games beautifully in the series, making something that still feels unique.</description>

      <description>I needed Windows to run SimTower, so I decided to try getting Win95 to run on DOSBox. The walkthroughs online had some skippable steps and I ran into some problems, and then I got distracted optimizing it.</description>

      <title>SimTower Max Tower</title>
      <link>https://relentlessoptimizer.com/gaming/2021/03/17/simtower-max-tower/</link>

      <description>A few days after my previous SimTower adventure, I wanted to revise my tower design. My retail-heavy-attempt was straightforward and didn&amp;rsquo;t take too many floors, but I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to try to build consistently all the way up to the 100th floor cathedral, and to try to max out many of the in-game limits right when I reached it.</description>

      <description>When playing through SimTower again, I was frequently looking for facts from the help and from online walkthroughs. Here&amp;rsquo;s a double-checked, complete set of the details I was looking for when replaying the game, with more useful details together in one place than the original help.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 1994, and Maxis is a big name in gaming. The excellent SimCity 2000 released last year, but we&amp;rsquo;re looking at a lesser known title, SimTower.</description>
