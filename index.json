[{"content":"Once you retire, which accounts should you take your retirement spending from first? If you retire before age 59.5, how do you get IRA money out at all? Are there any retirement tax surprises to watch out for?\nIf you are many years from retirement, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about this stuff. Save in the right account types with the right investments and don\u0026rsquo;t try to pre-plan for your 2040 taxes right now. Tax laws change.\nApproximate Federal Taxes Taking your retirement money in the right mix from different account types can drastically lower your taxes. I tried to write an accurate but simplified summary of the tax rules. It was still a mess. So here\u0026rsquo;s a version which provides approximate tax amounts with much, much less complexity.\nFirst, there are three types of income:\n   Income Type Tax % Sources     Ordinary 10% - 37% - Job Income\n- Social Security Income*\n- Tax-Deferred withdrawals (ex: IRA)\n- Taxable Bond interest   Qualified 0% - 24% - Taxable withdrawals (capital gains)*\n- Taxable Stock Dividends*   Tax-Exempt 0% - Tax-Free withdrawals (ex: Roth IRA)\n- Tax-Exempt Bond interest    Caveats (*) that matter:\n  Stock must be held for over one year for dividends to be Qualified income.\n  Stock must be held for over one year for capital gains to be Qualified income.\n  Social Security is ordinary income, but not all of it is taxed.\n  Next, there are tax brackets. For a married-filing-jointly couple in 2021:\n   Rough Bracket Sizes Ordinary Tax Rate Qualified Tax Rate     $24,000 0% 0%   $20,000 10% 0%   $60,000 12% 0%   $90,000 22% 15%   $160,000 24% 19%   [more] 32%-37% 19%-24%    The first \u0026ldquo;bracket\u0026rdquo; is really the \u0026ldquo;Standard Deduction\u0026rdquo;, and is tax-free for all income types. I\u0026rsquo;ve made the bracket sizes even numbers, but they actually change a little every year. The real \u0026ldquo;qualified\u0026rdquo; bracket sizes are different than the ordinary ones. There\u0026rsquo;s a 3.8% \u0026ldquo;net investment income tax\u0026rdquo; that shows up halfway through the \u0026ldquo;15%\u0026rdquo; qualified bracket. Crazy-pants.\nYour income \u0026ldquo;fills up\u0026rdquo; each tax bracket in order. Ordinary income is \u0026ldquo;filled in\u0026rdquo; first, and then qualified income second. If only a little of your income reaches into a new tax rate, only that part is taxed at the higher rate.\nSuppose you have $40,000 in ordinary income and $60,000 in qualified income. Here\u0026rsquo;s your estimate:\n   Rough Bracket Sizes Ordinary Income Ordinary Rate Qualified Income Qualified Rate Tax     $24,000 $24,000 0%  0% $0   $20,000 $16,000 10% $4,000 0% $1,600   $60,000  12% $56,000 0% $0    What happened? Ordinary income went first. $24,000 went into the first (0%) tax bracket. The remaining $16,000 went into the second bracket, for $1,600 ($16,000 x 10%) in tax. Next, $4,000 of qualified income filled the last of the second bracket, adding $4,000 x 0% = $0 tax. Finally, the remaining $56,000 of qualified income went into the third bracket, also adding $0 tax.\nIn total, your $100,000 in income cost only $1,600 in tax (1.6%). If instead you took the whole $100,000 from a tax-deferred account, your tax would be $9,600.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re saying, \u0026ldquo;Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s way less good!\u0026rdquo;, you\u0026rsquo;re right! That\u0026rsquo;s why this topic matters. If you keep your ordinary income in the first two brackets, they are barely taxed. If your qualified income stays within the first three brackets, it\u0026rsquo;s totally tax-free.\nHow close is the $1,600 estimate to the real numbers? Use the TaxCaster app to get real numbers quickly. For our example, the tax is actually $1,523. Close enough? Close enough.\nWhich Accounts First? Now that we know some tax basics, where should your retirement spending come from?\nIn short, usually this order:\n Taxable Dividends and Interest Tax-Deferred Withdrawals Taxable or Tax-Deferred Withdrawals Tax-Free Withdrawals  Why? Let\u0026rsquo;s dig in a bit.\nFirst, you get to pay tax on any dividends and interest in your taxable account no matter what, so you might as well use them for part of your spending. If your account is set up to reinvest them, change it to withdraw them instead when you retire.\nSecond, as you saw above, the first bracket (standard deduction) is tax-free no matter what. Take some money from your tax-deferred accounts to take maximum advantage of that 0% rate.\nThird is a toss up. You can take more tax-deferred withdrawals at the relative bargain 10% and 12% tax rates in the next two brackets. Or, you could take from taxable accounts for zero tax.\nHuh? Why not just use taxable accounts for all of this range?\nWell, when you turn 70, you will have Social Security income and mandated minimum tax-deferred withdrawals (see RMDs in the next section). Together, these might cause a much higher tax rate than you had earlier in retirement. If they do, it might be a better overall deal to spend IRA money sooner to reduce taxes later.\nFourth, your tax free accounts are always free, of course, so if you are near one of the \u0026ldquo;tax surprises\u0026rdquo; below, you can lower your taxable income by taking some tax free money to avoid them. Tax-free accounts are also best to spend last because if your portfolio grows really well, they don\u0026rsquo;t hurt so much when you raise your retirement income and are the most tax-efficient for people to inherit.\nRetirement Tax Surprises With all of the different income sources and subsidies that come together in retirement, there are some combinations which can cause really high tax increases for small changes in income. Look out for:\nSocial Security Taxation As mentioned, your Social Security income is not all taxed. There\u0026rsquo;s a formula which decides how much (between 0% and 85%) is taxed. If you have $45,000 in other income, your Social Security income is 85% taxed. Otherwise, put your numbers into TaxCaster and then try again with $1,000 less in non-Social Security income. If your tax goes down by $400+, it\u0026rsquo;s because you are in the \u0026ldquo;Social Security tax bump\u0026rdquo;, and taking some tax-free account money could reduce your taxes quite a bit.\nRequired Minimum Distributions (RMDs) At age 70 (well, 70.5) you start being required to take money out of your tax-deferred accounts. The government is tired of waiting for that tax money. This can mean much higher taxes than the earlier part of your retirement.\nWhen you retire, find out what your Social Security income and early RMD amounts will be. If the taxes are much higher than your pre-age-70 plan, meet with a tax professional to work through your options for optimizing things.\nMedicare IRMAA Thresholds If you have Medicare, your premiums go up if your income is too high. These are called \u0026ldquo;IRMAA\u0026rdquo; charges. In 2021, these happen at a (married-filing-jointly) income over $176k.\nACA / Obamacare Subsidy Cliff If you are under 65 and get health insurance from the ACA exchanges, you can get (substantial) subsidies to help pay for your premiums. These subsidies abruptly disappear at 400% of the \u0026ldquo;federal poverty level\u0026rdquo; for your household size. This is called the \u0026ldquo;ACA subsidy cliff\u0026rdquo;. In 2021, for two people, that\u0026rsquo;s $69,680. If your income will be close to that amount, it\u0026rsquo;s probably a very good deal to stay just under that threshold.\nGetting IRA Money Before Age 60 The advice above is great if you\u0026rsquo;re 60+ and can pull from any account, but how do you get money out of tax-deferred retirement accounts (401(k)s and IRAs) before 60? The rules seem clear: pay a 10% penalty for withdrawals before age 59.5. However, there is a workaround - \u0026ldquo;Roth ladders\u0026rdquo;. There are two rules which make them work:\nFirst, you are allowed to \u0026ldquo;convert\u0026rdquo; money from a regular IRA to a Roth IRA at any time. You pay taxes on any amount you convert as ordinary income, since you didn\u0026rsquo;t pay tax putting it into the IRA and won\u0026rsquo;t pay tax taking it out of the Roth IRA. You can convert as much as you want each year no matter your income. No limits.\nSecond, you are allowed to take contributions out of a Roth IRA any time. You only have to wait until age 59.5 to take out growth. Roth conversion amounts count as contributions.\nSo, can you just convert IRA money to a Roth and immediately take it out? No, the government thought of that. There\u0026rsquo;s one more rule - you can\u0026rsquo;t take out a Roth converted amount for five years after the conversion.\nHmm, so what if you convert one year of spending every year, and then after five years, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a five-year-old conversion available to take out? This is a Roth ladder, and this is allowed.\nSo, Roth ladders require you to pay for the first five years of retirement some other way. If you have a brokerage account, you can use that. If you contributed to your Roth IRA while working, those contributions are usable immediately. You could do some last saving in a bank account to cover it. Or, if you have to, use IRA money and pay the penalty for the first few years.\nAlso, note that you\u0026rsquo;re still paying the same tax as you would from regular IRA withdrawals - you\u0026rsquo;re converting one year of spending per year. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a tax break, just a way to use your IRAs early.\nYou might read about another option for early withdrawals - \u0026ldquo;Substantially Equal Periodic Payments\u0026rdquo; (SEPP). Roth ladders are just better, though. If you start SEPP payments, you must continue until age 60. If you make a mistake, you owe penalties on everything you\u0026rsquo;ve taken out. A Roth ladder does the same thing with more safety and flexibility.\nDonating Money I know, this is getting long. A quick word on donating money - if you have a plush retirement and want to make a lot of charitable donations, read about \u0026ldquo;qualified charitable donations\u0026rdquo; (QCDs) and \u0026ldquo;donor advised funds\u0026rdquo; (DAFs). These are ways you can get money from your retirement accounts to charities without triggering any taxes in the middle.\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/06/05/getting-retirement-money-out/","summary":"Once you retire, which accounts should you take your retirement spending from first? If you retire before age 59.5, how do you get IRA money out at all?","title":"Getting Retirement Money Out"},{"content":"You\u0026rsquo;re ready to start saving for retirement, but there are several different accounts you could use. Brokerage accounts, IRAs, Roth IRAs, 401(k)s. Where should your retirement savings go, and why?\nRetirement Account Types Broadly, there are three categories of retirement accounts, called \u0026ldquo;taxable\u0026rdquo;, tax-deferred\u0026quot;, and \u0026ldquo;tax-free\u0026rdquo;.\nFirst, you could just open a regular brokerage account to buy index funds (or individual stocks, or other mutual funds). These are just like a regular bank account. You put in regular after-tax money, and you pay tax on any dividends you earn every year. When you sell shares of a fund, you also pay capital gains tax on any gains since you bought it. You can put as much money in as you want, and take it out whenever you want. These accounts are \u0026ldquo;taxable\u0026rdquo; accounts, since they just follow the same tax rules as a regular bank account.\nIf you save in an IRA, 401(k), or 403(b) instead, you get some bonuses. First, you get to deduct your contributions from your taxable income. If you are in the 25% tax bracket and you put $1,000 into an IRA, you put in $1,000 but then get $250 off on your federal taxes. Overall, you got $1,000 in retirement money for only $750 less in after-tax income. Even better, any dividends or gains you get inside these accounts doesn\u0026rsquo;t get taxed, so they grow as much as possible. There is a downside, however - you have to pay tax on all of the money you take out as if it was normal income. You also (normally) can\u0026rsquo;t get the money out until you reach age 59.5. There are limits to how much you can put in each year. These accounts are \u0026ldquo;tax-deferred\u0026rdquo;, because you defer any tax on the money until you take it out.\nYou can also save in an account called a Roth IRA. Like the IRA, any dividends or gains in the account are tax-free. Unlike a normal IRA, though, the contributions are not deducted from your taxes. In exchange, when you take the money out, you pay no tax at all. You can\u0026rsquo;t take any growth in the account until age 59.5, but you can take out your original contributions any time. Some 401(k) accounts also let you make \u0026ldquo;Roth contributions\u0026rdquo; to them, which act just like a Roth IRA. These accounts are \u0026ldquo;tax-free\u0026rdquo;, because you pay no tax on the growth from them.\nWhich is Best? Which account type should you use? As I\u0026rsquo;ve said earlier, your taxes are usually much lower when you retire. So, most people should use a tax-deferred account like a 401(k) or IRA first, getting a big tax discount now rather than a smaller one later.\nFor an IRA, you may only contribute a certain amount per year ($6,000 in 2021, or $7,000 if you are age 50 or older) and you may only contribute if your income is under a certain limit ($198,000 for a married-filing-jointly couple in 2021).\nFor a 401(k), there is also an annual contribution limit ($19,500 in 2021, or $26,000 if you are 50+), but no income limit.\nAfter you\u0026rsquo;ve filled up your tax-deferred options, look for tax-free options next. The IRA contribution limit is shared with Roth IRAs, so if you contributed as much as you\u0026rsquo;re allowed to an IRA, you can\u0026rsquo;t contribute anything to a Roth. While there is an income limit for Roth IRA contributions, there\u0026rsquo;s a weird tax rule which allows you to contribute after-tax to a regular IRA and then move that money into a Roth IRA. This is called a \u0026ldquo;backdoor Roth\u0026rdquo; contribution.\nIf your 401(k) allows \u0026ldquo;after-tax contributions\u0026rdquo; (separate from regular and Roth contributions) and \u0026ldquo;in-service distributions\u0026rdquo;, you can contribute money over the normal 401(k) limit as \u0026ldquo;after-tax\u0026rdquo; contributions and then ask your company 401(k) provider to turn it into a Roth 401(k). This is called a \u0026ldquo;mega backdoor Roth\u0026rdquo; contribution. There is a limit to how much your 401(k) contributions plus any company match plus any after-tax contributions can be ($57,000 in 2021), so the limit for just your after-tax contributions depends on that.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve hit the tax-deferred and tax-free contribution limits and still have more to save (bravo!), it\u0026rsquo;s finally time to contribute to regular taxable accounts.\nSpecial Cases I\u0026rsquo;ve said taxes are usually much lower in retirement. If, for some reason, you expect higher taxes in retirement, save in tax-free accounts first.\nIf you have money you want to save for retirement but might need it sooner, you can save in a taxable account so that you can get the money early if you need it. For example, if you\u0026rsquo;re worried that the college fund for your kids won\u0026rsquo;t be enough, you could put some savings in a taxable account for easy access if needed.\nFinally, if you\u0026rsquo;re getting close to retirement and will retire before age 59.5, you should save up for the last few years in a taxable account. Basically, you can get money from tax-deferred and tax-free accounts before age 59.5, but you need a few years of spending in a taxable account to get things started.\nWhich Investments in Which Accounts? So, if you decide you want 75% stock and 25% bonds, should each of your accounts have exactly that ratio? Well, no.\nFirst, let me say that if you only have one kind of account (all tax-deferred), you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about this. It\u0026rsquo;s also not a big deal until your account balances get relatively large. (So you don\u0026rsquo;t need to figure this out to get started.)\nThat said, money you take out of a tax-free account is tax-free, money from a tax-deferred account is taxed at high rates, and money from a taxable account is taxed at moderate rates. You ideally want your fast-growing investments (stock) in your tax-free accounts, and your slow-growing investments (bonds) in your tax-deferred accounts.\nIn your taxable accounts, interest from bonds is taxed at a high rate, while dividends and gains from selling stock are taxed at a lower rate. So, if all of your bonds fit in your tax-deferred accounts, great. If not, consider tax-exempt bonds in your taxable account.\nAnother consideration is \u0026ldquo;rebalancing\u0026rdquo; - exchanging one investment for another to keep your target stock and bond percentage consistent. If you rebalance in a taxable account, you have to pay taxes on any gains from stock you sell. You might end up keeping some stock in your tax-deferred accounts just so that you can do your shuffles there.\nThese tactics can help optimize your taxes somewhat, but don\u0026rsquo;t let these considerations keep you from having the percentage of stocks and bonds you feel comfortable with. If you want more bonds than you have room in your IRA for, buy them. Don\u0026rsquo;t let the \u0026ldquo;tax tail wag the dog\u0026rdquo; as they say. Also, if you have enough retirement savings that the interest and dividends are causing you a lot of taxes, it\u0026rsquo;s a very good sign for your retirement. =)\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/06/04/retirement-account-types/","summary":"You\u0026rsquo;re ready to start saving for retirement, but there are several different accounts you could use. Brokerage accounts, IRAs, Roth IRAs, 401(k)s.","title":"Retirement Account Types"},{"content":"In \u0026ldquo;How Much You Need To Retire\u0026rdquo;, you learned that you need to save about 25 times your retirement spending to retire. When I first heard that number, I thought saving that much would take forever. Fortunately, there are two giant tailwinds to help: compounding returns and decreasing spending.\nEarly Retirement Sample Situation Now, let\u0026rsquo;s set up a (reasonable) example so we have some concrete numbers to talk about. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you\u0026rsquo;re married, and this is your situation:\n   While Working Yearly Amount     Household Income $100,000   Social Security and Medicare Tax $7,650   Federal Taxes $7,450   Mortgage $30,000   Retirement Saving $10,000   Other Spending $45,000    What will things look like for this couple when retired?\n   Retired Yearly Amount     Federal Taxes ??   Property Taxes (mortgage paid off) $6,000   Health Insurance (no longer work-provided) $4,000   Other Spending $45,000    First, our couple is done saving for retirement, and they no longer have to pay Social Security and Medicare tax. With a paid off house, their $30k/yr mortgage ($2,500/mo) is replaced by $6k/yr in property taxes. However, they have to pay for healthcare.\nHow much are their Federal Taxes?\nAt the highest, their taxes will now be $3,712, if all of their retirement income comes from an IRA or 401(k) and taxed as \u0026ldquo;ordinary income\u0026rdquo;. Even so, they will pay less than a quarter of the tax they had to pay when working! If half of their spending comes from Social Security ($28k), their total tax goes down to just $823, because their Social Security will only be partially taxed. If instead of Social Security, half comes from dividends in a taxable brokerage account, their taxes go down to just $323 because dividends at this income level aren\u0026rsquo;t taxed at all!\nSo, in summary, our couple went from paying $15,100 in federal taxes each year to $3,712 (worst-case) or potentially less than $1,000 per year depending on where their retirement income comes from.\n   Retired Yearly Amount     Retirement Income (all IRA or 401(k)) $59,000   Federal Taxes $3,712   Property Taxes (mortgage paid off) $6,000   Health Insurance (no longer work-provided) $4,000   Other Spending $45,000    Let\u0026rsquo;s stick with the worst-case retirement taxes and no income from Social Security. Our couple estimates that they need $59,000 in retirement income, which means $1,475,000 saved up ($59k x 25).\nAbout Inflation When talking about retirement money, you need to remember inflation. Something which cost $100 in 1991 costs about $200 in 2021, 30 years later. If you decide you\u0026rsquo;ll need $1,500,000 to retire, you want to know when you\u0026rsquo;ll have that much in today\u0026rsquo;s dollars, rather than the less-valuable dollars of the distant future. To do that, you just need to find out the \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;inflation-adjusted\u0026rdquo; returns of different investments.\nAn example: If you invested $100 in an S\u0026amp;P 500 index fund in 1991 and left it alone, that account balance would now be $2,230. However, since prices are about twice as high now, the account is really worth about $1,115 in \u0026ldquo;1991-equivalent dollars\u0026rdquo;. The S\u0026amp;P 500 had a 10.94% annualized return since 1991, and an 8.46% inflation-adjusted annualized return.\nBelow, all of my numbers are after-inflation returns, so you can use them to understand how money you invest will grow in \u0026ldquo;today-equivalent dollars\u0026rdquo;.\nCompounding Returns Between 1871 and 2021, an S\u0026amp;P 500 index fund provided an after-inflation annualized return, including dividends, of 7.04% per year. How much does this matter?\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re saving $10k per year, in year two you\u0026rsquo;ll find that the $10,000 from the first year grew to $10,704. Not terrible, but not much of an impact compared to the money you put in.

You might also be discouraged, though, because it takes a long time for that compounding ball to really get rolling.\nIs there anything you can do to speed it up, or do you just get it going and then have to sit on your hands for a few decades? That\u0026rsquo;s where decreasing spending picks up.\nOnce you have an effective budget, you\u0026rsquo;re in control of how much you spend. At first, you set aside savings to get that ball rolling. What happens if as you get raises and find ways to trim your bills, you keep choosing to save more and more?\nIn this example, let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens if every year you find another $500 to save. Since you spend just under $50,000 per year on \u0026ldquo;Other Spending\u0026rdquo;, this is only a 1% cut to your spending each year (and saving an extra 0.5% of your pre-tax income).\nDo you think it will help much?\n   Year Start Balance Growth You Add End Balance Retirement Budget Portfolio Needed     1 $ - $ - $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ 59,000 $ 1,475,000   2 $ 10,000 $ 704 $ 10,500 $ 21,204 $ 58,500 $ 1,462,500   3 $ 21,204 $ 1,493 $ 11,000 $ 33,697 $ 58,000 $ 1,450,000   4 $ 33,697 $ 2,372 $ 11,500 $ 47,569 $ 57,500 $ 1,437,500   5 $ 47,569 $ 3,349 $ 12,000 $ 62,918 $ 57,000 $ 1,425,000   6 $ 62,918 $ 4,429 $ 12,500 $ 79,847 $ 56,500 $ 1,412,500   7 $ 79,847 $ 5,621 $ 13,000 $ 98,469 $ 56,000 $ 1,400,000   8 $ 98,469 $ 6,932 $ 13,500 $ 118,901 $ 55,500 $ 1,387,500   9 $ 118,901 $ 8,371 $ 14,000 $ 141,271 $ 55,000 $ 1,375,000   10 $ 141,271 $ 9,946 $ 14,500 $ 165,717 $ 54,500 $ 1,362,500   11 $ 165,717 $ 11,666 $ 15,000 $ 192,383 $ 54,000 $ 1,350,000   12 $ 192,383 $ 13,544 $ 15,500 $ 221,427 $ 53,500 $ 1,337,500   13 $ 221,427 $ 15,588 $ 16,000 $ 253,016 $ 53,000 $ 1,325,000   14 $ 253,016 $ 17,812 $ 16,500 $ 287,328 $ 52,500 $ 1,312,500   15 $ 287,328 $ 20,228 $ 17,000 $ 324,556 $ 52,000 $ 1,300,000   16 $ 324,556 $ 22,849 $ 17,500 $ 364,904 $ 51,500 $ 1,287,500   17 $ 364,904 $ 25,689 $ 18,000 $ 408,594 $ 51,000 $ 1,275,000   18 $ 408,594 $ 28,765 $ 18,500 $ 455,859 $ 50,500 $ 1,262,500   19 $ 455,859 $ 32,092 $ 19,000 $ 506,951 $ 50,000 $ 1,250,000   20 $ 506,951 $ 35,689 $ 19,500 $ 562,141 $ 49,500 $ 1,237,500   21 $ 562,141 $ 39,575 $ 20,000 $ 621,715 $ 49,000 $ 1,225,000   22 $ 621,715 $ 43,769 $ 20,500 $ 685,984 $ 48,500 $ 1,212,500   23 $ 685,984 $ 48,293 $ 21,000 $ 755,277 $ 48,000 $ 1,200,000   24 $ 755,277 $ 53,172 $ 21,500 $ 829,949 $ 47,500 $ 1,187,500   25 $ 829,949 $ 58,428 $ 22,000 $ 910,377 $ 47,000 $ 1,175,000   26 $ 910,377 $ 64,091 $ 22,500 $ 996,968 $ 46,500 $ 1,162,500   27 $ 996,968 $ 70,187 $ 23,000 $ 1,090,154 $ 46,000 $ 1,150,000   28 $ 1,090,154 $ 76,747 $ 23,500 $ 1,190,401 $ 45,500 $ 1,137,500    Believe it or not, this change brought your retirement forward by eight years, from a 36 year wait to a 28 year wait.\nFirst, the bigger savings means that after 28 years, you saved $1,190,401 instead of $812,328. It\u0026rsquo;s a big difference. In addition, however, you slowly trimmed your expenses from $59,000 at first to $45,500 at the end, reducing the amount you needed for retirement from $1,500,000 to $1,137,500. Together, these two changes gave you eight extra years of freedom.\nIs this plausible? Saving an extra 0.5% per year sounds reasonable, but cutting your spending from $59k to $45.5k, even over a long time, sounds hard.\nHowever, when there\u0026rsquo;s 2% inflation (as has been the average in recent US history), this really means getting by with just a 1% raise in spending each year. If you only got 1% raises, could you manage? You need to find things to trim here and there as prices go up, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible, and it can make a huge difference in your retirement over time. More on that in another post.\nYears to Retirement Table In our original example, we saved 10% of our income and our retirement budget was 60% of our income. What happens at higher and lower savings rates?\nIn this table, I keep 30% of income as the \u0026ldquo;fixed\u0026rdquo; part (taxes and mortgage, approximately) and assume that every time you save an extra 5% of your income, your spending also goes down by 5% of your income. Here are the \u0026ldquo;years to retirement\u0026rdquo; for various savings rates:\n   Save % Fixed % Spend % Years to Save One Year Years To Retire     5% 30% 65% 13.0 46.6   10% 30% 60% 6.0 36.0   15% 30% 55% 3.7 29.5   20% 30% 50% 2.5 24.8   25% 30% 45% 1.8 21.0   30% 30% 40% 1.3 17.8   35% 30% 35% 1.0 14.9   40% 30% 30% 0.8 12.4   45% 30% 25% 0.6 10.0   50% 30% 20% 0.4 7.8    As you can see, the original \u0026ldquo;save 10%, need 60%\u0026rdquo; row has 36 years to retirement. Ramping up saving from 10% to 20% brings your retirement date from year 36 to year 25, 11 years sooner! This is mostly because you doubled your savings (10% -\u0026gt; 20%), but the slightly reduced retirement spending ($60k to $50k) also helped.\nIf you went crazy and doubled savings again, you might expect the retirement date not to get much better, because there\u0026rsquo;s a lot less time for the compounding ball to roll. However, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the case - going from 20% to 40% savings brings retirement another 12 years closer, from year 25 to year 12.5. In this latter case, the biggest difference is spending dropping drastically ($50k to $30k).\nSpending only 30% of your income isn\u0026rsquo;t realistic for most people, but with a huge income or a very modest lifestyle, it\u0026rsquo;s possible - that\u0026rsquo;s how a lot of the very early retirement bloggers have done it.\nThe big point here is that while compounding can grow huge amounts of money over time, having a high savings rate (or relentlessly raising it) can also drastically bring in your retirement date through the combination of more money to grow and less money you need.\nConclusion So, how long do you need to retire? If you save 10% of your income and need 60% of it in retirement, you should be done in about 36 years with an S\u0026amp;P 500 index fund. Doubling your savings rate will allow you to retire about ten years sooner, as will halving your retirement expenses. Since saving more also normally means spending less, even small cuts along the way can make a huge difference.\nWant to plug in your own numbers?

How much money will you need to save up?\nTL;DR: You need about 25 times your retirement spending invested in a 50% stock / 50% bonds portfolio for a 30 year retirement. Put another way, you can spend about 4% of your initial portfolio balance per year. For a 50+ year retirement, plan on 3.5% (or save 28.5 times your spending) and have 60-75% stock.\nRetirement Spending vs. Pre-Retirement Income Notice that the rule of thumb above is a multiple of your retirement spending, not your pre-retirement income. How are they different?\nIn retirement, you will (or can) have:\n No payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare Tax; 7.65% of your gross pay) Much Lower Income Tax (for us, about 20% income tax when working to less than 2% retired) No mortgage (pay off your house first) No retirement saving (you finished that already) No kids to support (if you have some still at home now) Health Care to pay for (via Medicare or the ACA Exchange)  See our example couple, who earns $100k and goes from paying $15.1k tax when working to $3.7k or less in retirement.\nYour retirement spending is likely to have a lot of other small differences - maybe more spending on hobbies but less on gas since you\u0026rsquo;re not commuting - but they are hard to predict before you make the leap into post-work life.\nYou may be tempted to try to make a precise estimate, but unless you\u0026rsquo;re quite close to retirement, a lot is likely to change between now and then. To get an initial idea of the income you\u0026rsquo;ll need in retirement, take your annual income and take out taxes, your mortgage, and your current retirement savings, and add back property taxes. When you start getting close to retirement, you can get more precise by getting current health insurance costs and subsidies for your planned income and adding any remaining mortgage payoff amount, among other things.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Forget Social Security It\u0026rsquo;s easy to dismiss Social Security as an income source. You may think Social Security won\u0026rsquo;t be there when you retire, that it will start paying too long after you retire, or that it will not cover much of your spending, but it\u0026rsquo;s worth looking up your benefit and factoring it in. You can find your income history from your Social Security statement, then fill in the Social Security calculator to see your benefit with no further contributions.\nIn 2021, a couple taking Social Security at age 70 with the maximum benefit would get $93,480 per year. Even half of that covers a significant retirement budget when there is no mortgage and minimal taxes to pay. In our case, even with only half-length careers, we\u0026rsquo;ll still get 75% of the maximum benefit. Social Security pays more of lower incomes, so your last working years increase your benefit much less than the first ones.\nWhat if you plan to retire at 40, waiting 30 years to start your maximum Social Security benefit? Crucially, it means most of your portfolio only has to last 30 years instead of 60, making 4% a much safer spending rate. If your budget is higher than the benefit you\u0026rsquo;ll get, you need to set aside a \u0026ldquo;mini-portfolio\u0026rdquo; to cover the remaining spending, but that part has 30 years to grow untouched.\nWhere is the 25x spending or \u0026ldquo;4% Rule\u0026rdquo; from? Back in 1994, retirement planners didn\u0026rsquo;t have a consistent answer to the \u0026ldquo;how much do I need\u0026rdquo; question, and a financial planner named William Bengen decided to come up with a definitive answer.\nHe assumed a family would:\n  Choose an initial income upon retiring, then increase it for inflation every year.\n  Invest half in stock (an S\u0026amp;P 500 index) and half in bonds (10 Year Treasuries).\n  Take out spending money and trade back to 50% stock and 50% bonds each year.\n  Need the money to last for 30 years.\n  Bengen looked at historical investment returns and inflation rates to find the highest initial income that lasted for 30 years even in the worst starting year in his data set. The worst year turned out to be 1966, where low returns and high inflation caused a lot of trouble right at the beginning of retirement, and in that year, choosing a starting income of 4% of the initial portfolio just barely lasted 30 years. He published \u0026lsquo;Determining Withdrawal Rates Using Historical Data\u0026rsquo; with his findings.\nWhile this analysis is simplistic, it\u0026rsquo;s a great starting point for planning and has become widely accepted in the financial planning industry.\nIssues with the 4% Rule You might wonder what the safe retirement spending (often called the SWR, or safe withdrawal rate) should be in different circumstances. For example:\n What about retirements longer (or shorter) than 30 years? What if you cut your budget in bad years? What if you don\u0026rsquo;t trade back to 50% stock / 50% bonds each year? What about stock percentages other than 50%? What if you add other investments (international stock, gold, real estate)?  These details matter, and they have been studied extensively. Since there are so many ways to handle the details, the more recent results really haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten the same broad acceptance as the original analysis.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re a long way from retirement, my advice is not to try to get overly precise. Use 4% as a planning number to estimate your retirement needs (and date) and come back for the details when you\u0026rsquo;re getting close to retirement day. For retirements of 50 years or longer, a rate closer to 3.5% is safer, though income later in retirement (see Social Security, above) and flexibility (see below) can make 4% fine even for long retirements.\nIf you want an in-depth analysis, check out Living Off Your Money by Michael McClung. McClung summarizes a lot of different research about how to invest, how much you can spend, and tactics for how to take the money out. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to know how well a strategy really works until it\u0026rsquo;s been around for ten years or so (with returns that the researcher didn\u0026rsquo;t use to design the strategy), so be skeptical of results much higher (or lower) than the norm.\nFlexibility is Key Probably the most unrealistic simplification of the 4% rule is that people would just pick an income on retirement day and then take an inflationary raise every year, completely ignoring the world around them.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re willing to skip raises, make spending cuts, or delay bigger purchases when returns are bad, research finds that you can use a distinctly higher initial spending rate (5.4% according to Guyton and Klinger).\nOften, if a retirement portfolio fails, it\u0026rsquo;s because returns at the very beginning of retirement are bad (or inflation is high) and the portfolio can\u0026rsquo;t grow enough to fund spending and recover. This means that delaying retirement if a crash happens right before you quit or doing a little consulting work at the beginning of a rough retirement makes a huge difference.\nOverall, if you\u0026rsquo;re flexible and ready to make some changes as your retirement unfolds, it\u0026rsquo;s really not too hard to safely navigate retirement even with a spending rate that seems a little high on paper. That\u0026rsquo;s what people did before Bengen came along in 1994, and it works, too. =)\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/06/02/how-much-you-need-to-retire/","summary":"So, you\u0026rsquo;ve decided to start saving for retirement.

I figured our phones would produce decently optimized JPG photos directly, but it turns out that a quick pass with an optimization tool reduced the sizes by half with no difference that I could perceive.\nI researched different tools (TinyPNG.com, TinyJPG.com, ImageMagick, PNGQuant), but it was important to me that the tool wouldn\u0026rsquo;t compress the photos too much, and I have too many photos to review the outputs manually. I finally found jpeg-recompress, which saves at multiple quality levels and runs a \u0026ldquo;human-perceived difference\u0026rdquo; algorithm to measure the perceived loss. It fits the bill perfectly. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get it to build, and there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a built Windows executable handy, but another repo has published releases (under vendor/win), or get it here (MIT license).\nFor archive quality, run jpeg-recompress with the default settings. You also want to run it in parallel across multiple threads, and it\u0026rsquo;s worth trimming unwanted metadata from your images. In my case, I want GPS locations and Date Taken, but none of the camera details (exposure time, ISO setting, camera model name). Metadata for my images was 60 KB per image. For my 70,000 images, that\u0026rsquo;s 4 GB of data I don\u0026rsquo;t want.\nI wrote a C# script to handle the threading; rather than publishing as an EXE, this makes it easy for others to alter the behavior and see what it\u0026rsquo;s doing. To run it, install dotnet-script, download my photo-optimizer zip, open a command prompt, go to the photo-optimizer folder, and run:\ndotnet-script main.csx \u0026#34;[InputRootPath]\u0026#34; \u0026#34;[OutputRootPath]\u0026#34; How did it do?

What should you invest in, and how do you go about that?\nTL;DR? Skip to Taking Action at the bottom.\nInvestment Options There are a lot of options for investing, and they can seem daunting. Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick overview of the major ones and what they really mean.\nWhen you buy stock, you are buying a portion of a company. As that company earns money and grows, they will return some of those earnings to you as dividends. Companies are a core part of how our economy works, and by owning them, you participate in the growth of our economy as a whole.\nWhen you buy bonds, you are loaning money to the federal government (treasury or agency bonds), local government (municipal bonds), or a company (corporate bonds). The entity borrowing your money promises to pay it back along with some interest.\nWhen you buy real estate, you own some of the housing, office, or retail space where people live, work, and shop. You participate in another big part of the economy through the rent you collect from your tenants.\nYou can also buy commodities, like corn, gold, or gasoline.\nYou can trade your dollars for other currencies, like euros or bitcoin.\nFinally, you can buy and sell options, which are usually the right to buy or sell something specific (like gasoline) at a pre-arranged price (like $3.50 per gallon) at a future date (like next July).\nWhich Investments are Best? So, which investment options are the best?\nCritically, stocks, bonds, and real estate generate some income for you while you hold them. Companies return some of their earnings to you as dividends. Bonds pay interest. Real Estate generates rental income. Holding these investments means holding a part of our economy and getting some ongoing benefit as a result.\nIn contrast, when you hold commodities, currencies, or options, there is no automatic income. The only way you make money from them is if you sell them for more than you bought them for. For every buyer, there must be a seller. If you make money from them, someone else had to lose that money. Across the whole market, the overall profit from these investments is zero. In other words, these three categories are a zero sum game.\nWith stocks, bonds, and real estate, there are still buyers and sellers, and with prices going up and down, people can make and lose money trading with each other. However, in addition to that, there\u0026rsquo;s a positive sum game where the people holding these investments are also making a profit from the income they generate. If you buy the investments and hold them for a long time without selling them, any amount you over- or under-paid initially will be a lot less important than the income generated while you\u0026rsquo;re holding it.\nFor this reason, many experts recommend stocks, bonds, and real estate as the primary investments to hold.\nRisk (or Volatility) Ultimately, your goal when investing is to grow your money as much as safely possible over the long term.\nWhy do I say safely? Because investments go up and down in value (they are volatile). Suppose you own a house. You can sell that house, but the price you\u0026rsquo;ll get for the house changes over time. Maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a new housing development or many of your neighbors are selling, so prices drop. Maybe a new company set up in town, so prices rise as new people are trying to move to town.\nMost of the time, the price doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, because you are not anxious to sell your house or buy another one. Also, you have the same house you did last week, and the mortgage you\u0026rsquo;re paying isn\u0026rsquo;t changing. You\u0026rsquo;re getting the same house for the same money as you did before.\nStocks, bonds, and real estate are like a house. The prices fluctuate, but prices only matter when you want to buy or sell them. If you\u0026rsquo;re saving for retirement, you\u0026rsquo;re buying investments that you won\u0026rsquo;t sell for a very long time, so the long term trend of prices matters, but the week-to-week (or even year-to-year) ups and downs really don\u0026rsquo;t.\nIf you are anxious to sell soon (you\u0026rsquo;re investing for your daughter\u0026rsquo;s college next year), these fluctuations do matter. Don\u0026rsquo;t buy stocks or bonds with this money - choose an investment which doesn\u0026rsquo;t have big daily ups and downs, like a savings account or a CD (certificate of deposit) at a bank.\nHowever, if an investment permanently lost value, like your house burning down, that would be a much bigger problem. Unfortunately, investments can experience losses like this, too. You can buy stock in a company which later goes bankrupt. You can lend money through bonds and then the borrower could default (fail to pay you back). You can buy real estate and it can burn down, or the town it\u0026rsquo;s in can enter a long-term depression.\nSo, how do you deal with this problem? Basically, \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t put all of your eggs in one basket\u0026rdquo;. If you own stock in one company, you\u0026rsquo;ll lose everything if that company goes bankrupt. If you own a hundred companies, one may go bankrupt each year, but the others will likely grow enough to make up for it. If you own a hundred houses in different towns (and states), one house burning down or one town going into decline aren\u0026rsquo;t catastrophic. If you own a hundred different bonds, one defaulting is ok.\nMutual Funds and Index Funds Ok, so stocks, bonds, and real estate are good categories to invest in, but you don\u0026rsquo;t want to put all of your eggs in one basket. How do you buy a hundred companies or houses with the money you have to invest? You buy a mutual fund.\nMutual Funds are where investors pool their money together and choose a manager to invest it for them. They allow people with a small amount of money to invest in a lot of different things easily. You can buy a US stock mutual fund which allows you to invest in all of the thousands of US companies with just $50.\nOf course, the people who run mutual funds want to make money. They do this by charging you a percentage of your money to buy and sell the fund (a \u0026ldquo;load\u0026rdquo;) or every year (an \u0026ldquo;expense ratio\u0026rdquo;). This is fine, if it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable, but it\u0026rsquo;s common for some funds to charge drastically more than others.\nIn addition, the person who chooses the investments for the mutual fund could be good or bad at picking investments (or could be winning this year, but losing next year after you\u0026rsquo;ve invested).\nSo, ideally, you\u0026rsquo;d like to find a mutual fund with very low costs and where you get all of the income from holding the investments over time without the risk of losses from bad trading choices. Enter the index fund.\nAn index fund is a specific type of mutual fund. Instead of the manager trying to actively choose winning stocks (and make money at the expense of the other managers and investors out there), an index fund just invests money to follow a particular index. If the index is a basket of all of the businesses in the US, for example, then the fund will just buy a slice of every stock. These funds tend to be very low cost, because you don\u0026rsquo;t need to hire a hotshot stock picker and pay handsomely hoping they\u0026rsquo;ll beat the other hotshots.\nHowever, the index also matters. If the index is 10% each in ten different companies, the fund will have to trade every day as the prices change to keep up with that ratio. Also, maybe those ten companies are all having a rough time in the economy overall.\nFortunately, you can get a broad, capitalization-weighted index and you don\u0026rsquo;t have these problems. These indices hold most or all companies, and weight each company according to the total value of all shares. If a fund is big enough to buy 1% of the stock market, it will be 1% of Apple, 1% of Amazon, 1% of Microsoft, and so on. If the price of Apple doubles and Amazon stays flat, there\u0026rsquo;s no trading to do - it still has1% of Apple and the others. The winners and losers of the economy go up and down, but the index represents everything together.\nThe S\u0026amp;P 500 is one of the oldest US stock capitalization-weighted indices, and the first index fund open to retail investors, the \u0026ldquo;Vanguard 500 Index Fund\u0026rdquo;, has provided better results than the vast majority of mutual funds over decades by just owning a slice of everything. Bonds have similar indices, most notably one called the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index. Since capitalization-weighted indices all have basically the same strategy - buy everything - you can compare the indices to each other to confirm they behave similarly and then choose an index fund based on any of them.\nNote that while stocks and bonds have good capitalization-weighted indices, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to invest in real estate this way and the companies that organize the real-estate funds (\u0026ldquo;REITs\u0026rdquo;) often take any extra return as profit. For this reason, we invest in stock and bond index funds and settle with just our own house as our real estate investment.\nPercentage Stocks and Bonds Ok, great. You know what to invest in, but how much of your money should go to stock versus bonds? Unfortunately the answer is \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s complicated\u0026rdquo;. Stock has a higher long term return, but also much more volatility. The decision about how to split your money up is called \u0026lsquo;Asset Allocation\u0026rsquo;, and different people will often choose differently based on how well they handle the day-to-day ups and downs of the market and how many years from now they\u0026rsquo;ll want the money.\nPeople a long time from retirement often want a high percentage of stock (80-90%) to maximize long term growth, and those close to or in retirement want less (40-60%) for less exciting ups and downs. It\u0026rsquo;s really not necessary to have more than 80% stock (returns are barely higher at 100% stock than 80%), and less than 30% stock is a bad idea even in retirement because returns become too low to keep up with spending and inflation over time.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve just been talking about \u0026ldquo;stock\u0026rdquo; here, but you can buy stock in US companies or companies from other countries. Opinions vary about how to much of your stock should be international. People often think having more stock in your local country is good. After all, the returns are in the currency you want to spend. Others want to own as much of the world as possible, and try to own the \u0026ldquo;capitalization-weighting\u0026rdquo; of every country. In our case, about a quarter of our stock investments are international stock.\nTaking Action To actually buy these funds, set up a mutual fund or brokerage account with a financial company and buy index funds from them. We personally invest through Vanguard and Fidelity, though you can usually buy these funds from a brokerage account with any other company, and BlackRock also offers excellent low cost index funds.\n    Vanguard Fidelity     US Stock Index VTSAX FSKAX, FZROX   International Stock Index VTIAX FTIHX, FZILX   US Bond Index VBTLX FXNAX    Don\u0026rsquo;t Take My Word For It Investing advice is all over, and it can be hard to decide what to believe.

In summary, stocks, bonds, and real estate are good investments because they generate income for you. Prices change from day-to-day, but the fluctuations only matter right when you\u0026rsquo;re buying and selling. You can buy stocks and bonds easily and efficiently through index funds. Make sure the index fund has a low expense ratio (0.10% or less), has no \u0026ldquo;loads\u0026rdquo; (no fees to buy and sell), and follows a capitalization-weighted index.\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/05/26/how-to-invest/","summary":"You\u0026rsquo;ve made a budget, done some initial saving, and now you finally have some savings to invest for retirement.

After knowing what went wrong, we made adjustments, and I\u0026rsquo;m happy to say that we retired again in 2020 and it\u0026rsquo;s been going much better. Without further ado, here are five things we did wrong (and five we did right) in our first retirement attempt:\nWrong: Had a Financial Advisor review right AFTER retiring You can fully plan retirement yourself, and I highly recommend it. I wanted a second opinion for such a big decision, however, so a asked a (fee-only) financial advisor for one. We found, however, that while advisors are comfortable telling a 60 or even 50 year old how much they need for retirement, many of them become very nervous and extremely conservative talking to someone 40 or younger. The truth is, though, that a 40 year retirement (age 50 to 90) already needs portfolio growth to keep up with inflation and make up for withdrawals, so studies looking at retirement rates suggest only slightly lower \u0026ldquo;safe withdrawal rates\u0026rdquo; for 50 or 60 year retirements. For example, the excellent Early Retirement Now chart estimates 95%+ safety from a withdrawal rate of 4.00% for 30 years, 3.75% for 40 years, and 3.50% for 50 and 60 years from a 75% stock portfolio.\nIf you talk to a financial advisor, do it before rather than after you stop working. If you get very conservative recommendations, ask what they would suggest if you were age 60 with the same portfolio to estimate how much they\u0026rsquo;re adjusting things for your age. In addition, keep in mind that an early retirement can be safer for younger retirees in some ways - social security is more like a \u0026ldquo;bonus\u0026rdquo; midway through retirement than something you\u0026rsquo;re depending on in your default plan, and it\u0026rsquo;s likely easier for you to go back to work if for some reason you need to.\nWrong: Checked our portfolio too often Fresh from the discouraging financial advisor review, I decided my main job was to make sure our portfolio would last. I went from checking our balances about monthly to basically every day, and getting caught up in the ups and downs caused me a lot of extra stress. It was hard to resist the urge to \u0026ldquo;do something\u0026rdquo; when I was transfixed by the daily activity. When I finally went back to checking monthly, I often saw that stock prices went on an adventure mid-month and then ended up about where they started.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to make changes based on day-to-day swings, so check your portfolio as infrequently as you can manage. As a retiree, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely want to rebalance using your withdrawals for spending, so take out enough for several months at a time and don\u0026rsquo;t worry about what\u0026rsquo;s happening in the middle.\nWrong: Didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to fill my time I noticed this after the two issues above, but it\u0026rsquo;s the most important problem with our first retirement attempt. We had taken some leaves of absence before quitting altogether, but my activities during the breaks were really pretty work-related, and without work projects to give me ideas to explore, I became bored. In the years afterward I\u0026rsquo;ve done a better job identifying hobbies I enjoy, and during our last leave I didn\u0026rsquo;t end up doing anything work-like at all. Since quitting in December, I\u0026rsquo;ve been constantly busy and much happier.\nPosters on the bogleheads forum, a fantastic retirement resource, often say \u0026ldquo;retire TO something, not FROM something\u0026rdquo; but I was frustrated at work and hope that it was more pithy phrase than wisdom. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know how you\u0026rsquo;ll fill your time in retirement, don\u0026rsquo;t wait until you quit to find out. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to find the time, but start on a few hobbies or projects and find something that grabs you before you have nothing else to do. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait until retirement is imminent to do this, either! =)\nWrong: Cut daycare way back for our young kids When we retired the first time, we had a one- and three-year-old at home, and we cut back from full time daycare to two half days per week, because we were both going to be home all the time. I love my kids and I love spending time with them, but children that young require constant supervision and get bored quickly. Caring for them all day was drastically different than spending a few hours between work and bedtime each day, and I really couldn\u0026rsquo;t spend much time on hobbies or independent activities even if I wanted to. On our second go-around, our kids are now six and eight, which makes a world of difference. They have school each day, they can play much more independently, and I can do a lot of my favorite activities with them (climbing, hiking, and camping) rather than only when my wife is on duty.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re in the (admittedly exceptionally rare) situation of considering retirement with young kids, I suggest setting aside money to keep up with full time daycare or a solid set of after-school activities for older kids. You\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy spending more time with them, but I think individual time to pursue your own interests is important to a happy retirement, too.\nWrong: Missed things in our budget Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong - we had a stable budget we\u0026rsquo;d lived on for years before retiring, so we had a very good idea what our spending would be. However, we didn\u0026rsquo;t look carefully at how we\u0026rsquo;d used our annual bonuses. We saved most of them each year, but we also set aside 10% for each of our \u0026ldquo;fun accounts\u0026rdquo; for individual purchases and sometimes used some bonus money to supplement our next car fund for a car purchase or our vacation fund during a higher travel year. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t set aside increased budget for hobbies, so we felt uncomfortable spending a lot more on them now that we had the free time.\nWhen setting up your retirement budget, live on it for a while, check for any \u0026ldquo;supplementing\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;re doing to it, and leave some space for extra activities and hobbies. It\u0026rsquo;s no fun to be retired and feel like you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t spend more on playing than you did when you were working and barely had time.\nRight: Did a retirement \u0026ldquo;trial run\u0026rdquo; Before quitting entirely, we were fortunate enough to take several three month unpaid leaves of absence during the summers to get a feel for it. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t trade back those blocks of free time with my family for anything. They were also great chances to try out our budget with retirement-level free time. That said, a three month break wasn\u0026rsquo;t a perfect simulation - I didn\u0026rsquo;t get out of the \u0026ldquo;honeymoon period\u0026rdquo;, so even though I hadn\u0026rsquo;t figured out hobbies, I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite get to feeling bored.\nStill, before you quit, try to ask about a leave of absence or try to save up vacation days for the longest break you can manage. It\u0026rsquo;s a great chance to get a sense for how retirement will feel with an \u0026ldquo;undo\u0026rdquo; option still available.\nRight: Was comfortable with portfolio ups and downs I realize that this contradicts \u0026ldquo;checked our portfolio too often\u0026rdquo; above, but once I settled back into monthly portfolio checks, I felt fine again. Having checked my portfolio monthly for a long time before quitting work, the monthly variations felt familiar and not out of scale with what I\u0026rsquo;d seen before.\nSo, while I would suggest checking your portfolio infrequently in retirement, before you quit make sure you check your portfolio often enough. The ups and downs feel different when you\u0026rsquo;re not adding any new savings every month, so being used to them before you quit really helps.\nRight: Had a plan for cutting our budget If you have a reasonable withdrawal rate, you likely will see few (if any) years that require you to make spending cuts. However, watching the 2015 flash crash after quitting felt a lot different than declines I lived through while working. The \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m buying stock on sale\u0026rdquo; feeling wasn\u0026rsquo;t there to make up for concern about whether this would derail our retirement plans.\nFortunately, I\u0026rsquo;d already written down a plan for spending cuts and a threshold - if our spending was more than 4.5% of our current portfolio, we would cut down to the 4.5% cutoff by reducing giving, our vacation fund, and our next car fund. Having a plan that a calm version of myself had written made me feel a lot better during those first declines. Our portfolio never dropped enough to trigger the 4.5% threshold, and I also felt good that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to agonize over a plan in real time or stress about whether the cuts would hurt, since I\u0026rsquo;d already thought them through.\nRight: Figured out healthcare before quitting Before we quit, I took the time to research plans on our state ACA (Affordable Care Act) website and found the current costs, so we knew exactly what to sign up for. I also looked into the premium subsidies and had a good idea what our subsidy would be at different potential income levels and where the sudden cutoffs were.\nIn addition to these, for our second retirement we made sure to use work healthcare benefits before leaving (LASIK!).\nRight: Figured out retired taxes before quitting Taxes in retirement deserve several dedicated posts, but let me summarize very briefly. We have money in IRAs, Roth IRAs, taxable brokerage accounts, and (a bit) in bank accounts, and so in retirement we have a lot of control over our taxable income and taxes. Our taxable account dividends are unavoidable but tax-efficient. We can get our remaining spending from cash or old Roth contributions for tax-free income, sell taxable stock for capital gains income, or make Roth conversions from our IRAs (for eventual spending) as regular income.\nWith these choices, you can tune your income to optimize your taxes. In our case, aiming for an income around $102,000 ($62k conversion + $40k dividends) causes a tax bill of under $100 (!) for our family, and is (just) low enough to keep us qualifying for ACA health care subsidies. With the pandemic, 2021 and 2022 have changed our optimal income, but afterward, this is the plan.\nI highly recommend estimating your in-retirement taxes with the free Intuit TaxCaster (I prefer the Android app) to quickly estimate taxes and try different situations, and you might consider using tax optimization software like I-ORP to plan out your Roth conversions if you have a lot of IRA savings.\nI hope this list helps a few aspiring retirees somewhere to avoid some of the pitfalls I unintentionally explored.\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/05/15/five-mistakes-we-made-during-our-first-early-retirement/","summary":"We retired early (the first time) in 2014 at age 33.

Sierra walked the line between adventure and puzzle games beautifully in the series, making something that still feels unique. Ultimately, though, what keeps bringing me back is the setting and the story, told with impressive graphics, great music, and witty dialog that still hold up well so many years later.\nI recently came back to play it again. You can find it on GOG, seven megabyte monster that it is. I highly recommend the excellent Gamer Walkthrough for it and a map, which are great for hitting the highlights and solving the more subtle puzzles.\nEven ten playthroughs in, walking out of town into the forest and hearing Hero\u0026rsquo;s March gives me that feeling of nervous excitement and imminent adventure.\nThe beautiful art has permanently established this setting - castles, forest, waterfalls, mountains - as the definitive role playing setting for me.

Puzzles, as noted earlier, can be quite hard if you haven\u0026rsquo;t talked to the right person. Magic is awkward to use outside combat.

I think it was released at just the right moment, when VGA graphics, SoundBlaster sound, and mouse interaction made games drastically more playable and immersive than they were just a few years earlier.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t a walkthrough, but I can\u0026rsquo;t help but leave a few tips:\n Sleep in Erana\u0026rsquo;s Peace - full healing, fruit to eat, and flowers to sell. Play the daggers game with the Chief Thief to quickly earn money. Work in the stables and practice with the Weapon Master to quickly improve your skills. Practice lockpicking safely at the Healer\u0026rsquo;s Hut (even in the daytime!) Battle the Goblins in their camp to finish training combat skills. Keep a few potions handy - running out of stamina can easily lead to death.  I took too many screenshots for one post, but you can find the full set here.

What should you do with the money?\n  Credit Card debt Emergency Fund (one month of expenses) Other Non-Mortgage Debt (car loan, student loans) Some Retirement Saving (get employer match) Future Big Purchases (house, trip, car, kid college) More Retirement Saving Audacious Goals: House Payoff, Early Retirement, Year off from Work, \u0026hellip;   First, if you have any credit card debt, pay it off. Put the credit cards away so you stop using them. Pay with a debit card instead. I know, debit cards don\u0026rsquo;t have rewards and fraud protection. But if you\u0026rsquo;re in debt, stopping the bank from taking your money every month in interest matters much more than the value of credit card rewards and the potential risk of losing some to fraud.\nOnce your credit cards are paid off, the interest you were paying is now free for other saving. If your \u0026ldquo;monthly bills\u0026rdquo; account included minimum credit card payments, that money can go to other goals now. Since \u0026ldquo;monthly bills\u0026rdquo; aren\u0026rsquo;t paid from your day-to-day checking account, the new savings won\u0026rsquo;t disappear into other spending.\nNext, start building up an emergency fund. Even if your month-to-month spending is manageable, surprises and emergencies will happen. Maybe your car breaks down, your roof starts leaking, or you get injured and have medical costs to cover. Your goal is to save up money to handle these kinds of situations without getting back into credit card debt. Having just one month of expenses saved up provides a huge boost to peace of mind, knowing that you can handle a surprise bill or manage if you lose your job without immediate disaster. Make sure to keep your new emergency money in a bank account you can easily access, because the point of the money is to be available instantly when you need it.\nAfter you\u0026rsquo;ve saved one month of expenses, I would suggest shifting most, but not all, of your saving to your next goals. Many people recommend saving six months of expenses in emergency money, but that takes a very long time and money set aside for later goals can often be repurposed as emergency money if needed.\nWith credit card debt gone and an emergency fund, it\u0026rsquo;s time to wipe out your other non-mortgage debt. If you have car loan or student loan, start allocating some of your money to pay those down. Once you pay off your current car, put your car payment money toward other debt, then accumulate it so that you can buy your next car without a loan.\nNow that any debt other than your house is out of the way, it\u0026rsquo;s a good time to start some retirement savings. If your job offers a 401(k), saving money for retirement will reduce your taxes. Many companies also offer to match some of your savings, providing a huge boost. You can also save pre-tax money for retirement in an IRA (individual retirement account) on your own. Try to save enough to maximize any matches, or about 5% of your income even if there aren\u0026rsquo;t any matches available.\nAlong with some initial retirement savings, you can start thinking about future big purchases. If you know you\u0026rsquo;ll want to buy a house, pay for college for kids, take a big trip, buy a fancier car, or make another big purchase in the next few years, start saving for those goals. Retirement saving is important for your future, but the point of saving is to help your present as well. Having some big spending goals you can achieve makes the benefits of saving feel a lot more real.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve paid off all of your debt, are making steady progress toward any big purchases, and still have money left, congratulations! It\u0026rsquo;s a great feeling. At this point you can work toward some truly audacious goals like early retirement, paying off your house, saving for a year off from work, and other things that most people aren\u0026rsquo;t able to do. If you ramp up retirement savings, take the time to estimate how much you\u0026rsquo;ll need for retirement. (More on that in a future topic). Retirement savings have no tangible, day-to-day benefit, so calculating how much your extra saving will increase your future lifestyle or allow you to retire sooner is really important to help keep you motivated.\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/04/13/what-to-save-for/","summary":"So you\u0026rsquo;ve made a budget and now you\u0026rsquo;re starting to save.

I\u0026rsquo;m not willing to buy coffee out every day, so I learned to make cold brew at home and mix reasonable replicas of my Seattle\u0026rsquo;s Best iced mocha and the Vanilla Sweet Cream between coffee outings.\nHome cold brew is great, but it\u0026rsquo;s annoying to make and easy to end up with a sour or bitter batch.\nNot long ago, I learned that Starbucks provides free refills.

We want the full $4,000 benefit from the two child tax credits, which are not fully refundable, which means at least $61,725 in ordinary income ($25,100 standard deduction + $19,750 x 10% + $16,875 x 12% = $4,000 tax). After that, another $44,425 of qualified income (qualified dividends or long term capital gains) are also tax free.\nHowever, our maximum tax free income of $106,150 goes over the income where ACA subsidies disappear, which is $104,800 (400% of the Federal Poverty Level or FPL).\nWith our taxable account interest and dividends, we can Roth convert about $52,000 per year with no tax cost other than a reduced ACA subsidy, which is effectively a 9.83% tax and a good deal to us.\nHowever, after reading an excellent summary of the American Rescue Plan, I found out that things will be a lot different for 2021 and 2022.\nFirst, the child tax credit is fully refundable, so we no longer need a particular minimum income to fully use the child tax credit.\nSecond, the ACA Premium Assistance Tax Credit (PATC, or \u0026ldquo;ACA subsidy\u0026rdquo; below) will be larger for 2021 and 2022. There\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;premium percentage\u0026rdquo; of your income that ACA expects you to pay for health care, but then the subsidy covers the rest of the cost of your local \u0026ldquo;benchmark plan\u0026rdquo;. These premium percentages are much lower for 2021 and 2022 at a wide range of income levels. Using the 2020 Federal Poverty Levels:\n   Income [% of FPL] Income [Family of 4] 2021-2022 Premium Percentage \u0026lsquo;Normal\u0026rsquo; Premium Percentage     \u0026lt; 133% \u0026lt; $34,846 0.00% 2.07%   133% $34,846 0.00% 3.10%   150% $39,300 0.00% 4.14%   200% $52,400 2.00% 6.52%   250% $65,500 4.00% 8.33%   300% $78,600 6.00% 9.83%   350% $91,700 7.25% 9.83%   400% $104,800 8.50% 9.83%   \u0026gt; 400% \u0026gt; $104,800 8.50% N/A (no subsidy)    Together, these two changes mean that a much lower target income is best, because we aren\u0026rsquo;t losing part of the child tax credit and the ACA subsidy decreases much more quickly as our income increases, acting like a higher marginal tax than normal.\nIn our case, it looks like our income for the next two years should be about $72,000 (275% of FPL), which is the maximum income at which our (bronze plan) ACA premiums are fully reimbursed.\nThis will mean doing a $22,000 smaller Roth conversion. Normally that would only save us $2,162 in ACA subsidies (9.83%), in which case we\u0026rsquo;d rather stick with the bigger Roth conversion. For 2021 and 2022, however, it\u0026rsquo;ll save $2,640 in federal tax (we\u0026rsquo;re not losing any child tax credit) and a stonking $5,600 in ACA subsidies, for a total of $8,240, almost four times the normal benefit.\nIf you receive the child tax credit, buy healthcare from the ACA exchanges, and have control over your taxable income, it\u0026rsquo;s worth looking to see if you should have a different plan for this year and next.\nA few more notes for 2021 and 2022:\n Stimulus checks are officially based on 2021 income, but will be sent based on your latest taxes filed when the IRS initially processes the payments. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to pay them back if your 2019 or 2020 taxes triggered a higher payment than your 2021 income would qualify for. You may want to delay filing taxes if your 2019 income was lower than 2020. Watch out for the $150,000 income level (MFJ) because any stimulus payment and the extra child tax credit very rapidly phase out. The ACA PATC is not limited to incomes under 400% of FPL, though your subsidy shrinks as you\u0026rsquo;re expected to pay 8.5% of your income toward the benchmark healthcare plan. There are also dependent care account, COBRA, unemployment assistance, and tuition debt  ","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/04/12/the-american-rescue-plan-aca-and-roth-conversions/","summary":"The American Rescue Plan became law on March 11th, 2021, and I was surprised to figure out that it changes the taxable income we want to aim for in 2021 and 2022 significantly.","title":"The American Rescue Plan, ACA, and Roth conversions"},{"content":"When we got our first real jobs, we put our paychecks into our checking account and bought everything from there. It couldn\u0026rsquo;t be easier, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure many people do the same thing. The problem was that while we didn\u0026rsquo;t spend more than we had, we also weren\u0026rsquo;t saving up anything. When we wanted to take a vacation, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear how we would pay for it. When we had an unexpected expense (a gift for someone, a car repair, or whatever) our account would be knocked down and we\u0026rsquo;d have to cut back for a while to try to refill it. It felt like we were constantly being knocked off track and forced to make cuts.\nThis went on until we decided we wanted to buy a house and realized we needed to save up a down payment. At the time we couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine saving up so much money. We read some articles about budgeting and tried tracking all of our expenses, but it felt like too much work. What we really wanted was a way to control our spending and do some saving without a lot of effort or a lot of compromises.\nEventually, we settled on the idea of having multiple accounts (doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound simple, does it?) and have stuck with that system ever since. First, we put our paychecks into a transfer account instead of our checking account, so that we could split up the money for different goals. Then, in addition to our checking account for day-to-day use, we opened a new account for our monthly bills, one for irregular spending, and one for each savings goal (next car, house down payment, vacations).\nWe added up our monthly bills and transferred the total to the bills account each month. Now we don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about the power bill knocking us off track. We added up our \u0026ldquo;day-to-day\u0026rdquo; purchases going back a month or two and transferred that amount to our checking account, so we weren\u0026rsquo;t really cutting back spending overall. We set aside a little big for each goal and put the rest in \u0026ldquo;irregular spending\u0026rdquo;.\nWhile simple, this change really helped. Our monthly bills didn\u0026rsquo;t catch us off guard anymore! We were automatically saving for irregular expenses, so we often could pay for them without transferring money from anywhere else. We could just look at the day-to-day account to decide how much to spend. If we wanted to eat out and the balance looked good, we could go for something fancier. If the balance was low, hot dogs at Costco or stay home. At first we didn\u0026rsquo;t allocate much to our other savings goals, but even a little was much better than nothing. Similarly, when deciding to take a vacation or looking at our next car, we again had one account balance to check to decide what we should spend.\nWhen we got our next raises, we found another benefit - the extra money accumulated in our transfer account instead of disappearing into new spending. We could intentionally allocate it, and we chose to save most of it for goals instead of automatically spending it all day-to-day. When we got our bonuses, we saved them rather than watching them melt in our checking account. When we found cheaper phone plans, the money was saved instead of vanishing elsewhere. This turned out to be the most important thing we did - saving most of our raises each year dramatically increased our savings rate over time.\nSo, that\u0026rsquo;s the process. No tracking every purchase, no spreadsheets, no budget software. Just separate accounts, automatic transfers, and one balance to check for any given spending decision.\nOne bonus trick: Our day-to-day account used to sometimes be a low on grocery day, and it felt bad to scrimp on groceries or gas to stay on budget. We shifted our day-to-day account transfers from bi-monthly (when our paychecks came) to weekly on Fridays. This means Friday night dinner and groceries and gas on Saturday are now always right after \u0026ldquo;payday\u0026rdquo;, and any cutting happens to Amazon purchases and lunches out midweek instead.\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/03/30/how-we-budget/","summary":"When we got our first real jobs, we put our paychecks into our checking account and bought everything from there.

The walkthroughs online had some skippable steps and I ran into some problems, and then I got distracted optimizing it.. Anyway, here are my terse, working steps for getting very nice Win95 DOSBox images.\nIn addition to a Win95 CD ISO and key, you\u0026rsquo;ll need:\n Empty FAT-16 HDD images S3 Video Driver DOS 6.22 Boot Disk  I\u0026rsquo;ve also packed up all of my DOSBox scripting, if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to copy and paste it from here.\nRecommendations Use Win95C (OSR 2.5) I saw the fewest unhandled exceptions and other problems with the last Win95 release.\nTrim the Win95 install CD You can delete all of the files on the Win95C CD which aren\u0026rsquo;t on the Win95A CD to get the latest Win95 fixes, but without all of the optional software (IE, AOL, \u0026hellip;). This also eliminated a few exceptions during the first boot. My scripting in Step 1 below copies the correct file list.\nMake a Win95 install CD hard drive I couldn\u0026rsquo;t mount the Win95 ISO so a DOS boot disk would see it. The walkthroughs copy the install directory to the target hard drive, but that means the target drive must be larger. Instead, I copied my (trimmed) Win95 setup folder to an empty hard drive image and then mount it along with the DOS Boot Disk and target drive to start setup.\nMount a second hard drive for each game You have to boot from an \u0026ldquo;img\u0026rdquo; file in DOSBox to run Win95, but IMG files take up the whole drive size, not just the used space. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to installing all of my games in the same Win95 image, which I could break easily, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want a huge Win95 starting image to install each game. Instead, you can leave the Win95 image small and mount a second empty drive for each game that\u0026rsquo;s the right size to install the game to.\nDOSBox.conf Template This is the DOSBox.conf template I used for each step below.

As long as you get the installs right and make backups of the images, you\u0026rsquo;re done.\nHowever, in a past life I automated more modern Win95 setups, so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but look into how Win95 installs are automated.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a tool on the Win95C CD in admin\\nettools\\bsetup called batch which will ask you for the answers to most questions setup.exe asks, and then write out a BSETUP.INF file you can use to automate. Pass this as an argument to setup.exe, and you\u0026rsquo;ve got an automated install:\nD:\\Win95\\setup.exe /im /is /IW D:\\Win95\\BSETUP.INF Here is the one I ended up with. I figured out everything except how to get it to look for a sound card, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to leave it fully automated (and, it got stuck on the exception setting up the Control Panel also).

My retail-heavy-attempt was straightforward and didn\u0026rsquo;t take too many floors, but I thought it\u0026rsquo;d be fun to try to build consistently all the way up to the 100th floor cathedral, and to try to max out many of the in-game limits right when I reached it.\nDesign My first realization was that I\u0026rsquo;d have to have a narrower tower in order to build all the way up. In my previous attempt, I\u0026rsquo;d only built 18 retail floors and I was nearly at the limit of commercial facilities (512), escalators, and elevators.\nIf I want to build all the way to the 100th floor, I have to keep to one escalator per floor. This means a maximum width of about 19 offices, or 19 x 9 = 171 segments. I want to make all-one-thing floors this time to keep the design more simple, so a width which has an even number of offices, retail shops, fast food, or twin hotel rooms would be nice.\nI settled on a width of 144 segments - 16 offices, 12 retail shops, 9 fast food, or 24 twin suites.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve got 7 lobbies to fill (1, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90). I have 64 escalators, so I can place 9 per lobby (though I think Sims will only accept 7). I\u0026rsquo;ll have to keep to three elevator shafts per lobby, so one express elevator and two normal shafts. This leaves me with three more shafts for service elevators. With a limit of 512 commercial spaces, that\u0026rsquo;s a bit over 73 per lobby. If I use a 144-width-tower, this works nicely as four floors of fast food and three floors of shops, for 72 facilities.\nI want offices throughout this time, but with only two elevator shafts I\u0026rsquo;ll need them to be on escalators to avoid overwhelming my elevators. Since I have to keep my fast food and retail shops within four levels of the lobby, I only have one floor left for offices.\nAnd in the empty floors I can\u0026rsquo;t reach from escalators and in excess of my seven retail floors, I\u0026rsquo;ll put hotel - high income and low traffic.\nEach full 144-width hotel floor has 24 twin rooms. The bottom floor of each batch has two housekeeping, three suites, and 14 twin rooms.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get to it!\nLobby Layout Here\u0026rsquo;s the basic template for each lobby:\n   Floors Facilities Pop $/Qtr [K]     20-25 6x Hotel 274 $1,260   17-19 3x Retail Shop 900 $540   16 Office 96 $160   15 Lobby     11-14 4x Fast Food 1,260 $324    So this is six hotel floors, four fast food, three retail shop, and one office. I kept two office floors above the first lobby, and B1 is parking, so there are only three fast food and two shop floors on the bottom lobby. The 90th floor lobby only has five hotel floors, since F100 is for the cathedral.\nSave - Offices and $60M\nSave - Just Before Cathedral\nTribulations This layout went up relatively smoothly, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t completely without problems. The elevators must be very carefully placed to get all of the shafts within the 144 width - the service elevators had to be at the outermost edges, and I had to rebuild the local elevators a few segments out from their original placement to fit all six express elevators with enough spacing.\nNext, I eventually needed 10 Recycling Centers, so I had to bump the main lobby out to a width of 150 to fit them across with room for the Metro Station. (Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to put the escalators to the Metro Station in before putting the Recycling Centers back!)\nFinally, my topmost Retail Shop floor, floor 94, couldn\u0026rsquo;t maintain enough traffic. Three floors of retail worked on the other lobbies, and no other facilities had bad reviews on the 90th floor lobby. I decided to replace the shops with restaurants, which didn\u0026rsquo;t have any problems and still kept my weekday population over 15,000.\nResult After a long night of building, I finally got it all done - it\u0026rsquo;s a monster! I\u0026rsquo;m using all 24 elevator shafts, 59 out of 64 escalators, and 477 of the 512 commercial facility limit. The population peaks at 21,643 on the first weekday evening (counting weekend retail traffic and with the hotel rooms filled), and still manages a 15,527 weekday minimum.\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/gaming/2021/03/17/simtower-max-tower/","summary":"A few days after my previous SimTower adventure, I wanted to revise my tower design.

At normal population, Fast Food income is $3k/day ($9k/qtr) and restaurants make $6k/day ($18k/qtr). Fast Food income is $3k per day with 40-48 customers, or $9k/qtr.

It turns out that you can build escalators on empty floors, so just bulldoze the offices right behind the stairs, then replace the stairs with an escalator, and then rebuild the offices. Sims will take a maximum of four flights of stairs, but seven escalators, so you can build out three levels above and four levels below each lobby with escalators.\nWhen does population update? Population is static for offices and condos. Hotel Population goes up and down as guest check in and out. Population for retail locations updates when they open to reflect the number of \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; customers the previous day. For example, if a Fast Food place has 48 customers on the weekend, the tower will count that population from 10am (opening) on the next day (weekday 1) until the opening two days later (weekday 2).\nWhat is the math for fast food population, and how do offices affect them? Fast Food, when newly built, has the following daily traffic: 10, 20, 20, 20, 35, 35, 35, 40, \u0026hellip;. Weekends get 20% extra traffic. Rainy days get about half the normal traffic. Fast Food places normally have 35 weekday customers and 48 weekend customers.\nIf office workers can get to the fast food place, five of the six office workers will visit a Fast Food place within range each weekday. Ideally, this means three offices can boost each Fast Food place to maximum revenue, but the distribution of bonus visitors is uneven, so you are likely to need four offices per fast food. These extra customers boost earnings (slightly), but are not counted again for the tower population, so they don\u0026rsquo;t help you earn a higher star rating.\nHow far away do facilities have to be to avoid noise problems? There must be at least 11 empty segments between the fast food and the office. Hotel rooms require 21 segments from an office. These gaps waste space quickly, so keeping whole floors all one type seems to work better.\nWhich facilities object to noise from one another? Offices object to noise from commercial (fast food, restaurants, retail, cinema). Hotels and Condos object to noise from commercial and offices.\nHow do housekeepers work? Each housekeeping facility has six housekeepers. They will only work on separate floors, so you need multiple housekeeping facilities and a service elevator to get several to clean one floor. Each housekeeper can clean 19 rooms, apparently, but I needed four housekeeping facilities to safely clean my 58 room floors and they didn\u0026rsquo;t finish until after 2:00pm.\nWhat are the best express elevator settings? Each express elevator shaft should only stop at the lobby and a single skylobby, so the cars just go back and forth. Two shafts with all eight cars each can serve each skylobby with the full eight full shopping floors. Configure the express elevators to wait 30 seconds to cause them to fill up more consistently.\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/gaming/2021/03/13/simtower-reference/","summary":"When playing through SimTower again, I was frequently looking for facts from the help and from online walkthroughs. Here\u0026rsquo;s a double-checked, complete set of the details I was looking for when replaying the game, with more useful details together in one place than the original help.","title":"SimTower Reference"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s 1994, and Maxis is a big name in gaming. The excellent SimCity 2000 released last year, but we\u0026rsquo;re looking at a lesser known title, SimTower. SimTower was not actually developed by Maxis, but instead by Yoot Saito, who was inspired by the 1989 SimCity. The game was released as \u0026ldquo;The Tower\u0026rdquo; in Japan and was relatively successful. Maxis learned about the game and offered to publish it in the US, branded as a \u0026ldquo;Sim\u0026rdquo;-title.\n26 years later, I\u0026rsquo;ve been digging up old games and wanted to really beat SimTower this time. Being from 1994, SimTower is actually a Windows 3.1 title, so you have to install Windows on DosBox to run it. I installed Windows 95 to run it, which took a few hours of attempts and ended up being a nostalgic journey itself. I\u0026rsquo;ve written up the steps that worked for me.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my first pass at \u0026ldquo;solving\u0026rdquo; SimTower. I was inspired by a very short and simple SimTower walkthrough, though I ended up using a Retail Store / Fast Food mix for higher income with similar population.\nSee my SimTower Reference for some tables I wish I\u0026rsquo;d had before playing SimTower again, cobbled together from a few different websites and corrected.\nQuick \u0026lsquo;TOWER\u0026rsquo; Walkthrough The map is 375 \u0026ldquo;segments\u0026rdquo; wide, but a 360 segment tower is much easier to fill evenly, so build a 360 segment lobby. Put three floors with 40 offices each on top. Add three stairways to serve them: after the 9th, 20th and 31st offices.\nNow, turn up the simulation speed and save up $60M. For maximum speed, close the Map Window, shrink the Main Window, look at the sky, and turn on \u0026ldquo;Fast Mode\u0026rdquo;. My 2020 laptop finished a quarter every 8 seconds like this, so it was only about a ten minute wait. Here\u0026rsquo;s my saved game, in case you want to skip that.\nNext, build an empty B1. Add matching stairs, two security offices on the left, and 10 Fast Food centered around the middle stairs.\nOnce you get three stars, add an empty 5F, B2, and B3. Replace all stairs with escalators, going all the way from B3 to 5F. You can bulldoze the offices to place escalators there, and then rebuild the offices. On B1, add a Medical Center next to the Security Offices. Under B3, add two Recycling Centers.\nNow we\u0026rsquo;ll add \u0026ldquo;shopping floors\u0026rdquo;, which have 15 Fast Food and 10 Retail Shops each. Make F5, B2, and B3 shopping floors. Wait for a quarter and confirm all of your facilities have a blue eval.\nTime for a small hotel. Add an empty F6. Add four elevator shafts, after office 8, 16, 24, and 32, set to wait 30 seconds before departure. On F6, add four Housekeepings, six suites, and 40 twin rooms. The four elevators should serve all of the rooms efficiently.\nTime for a Skylobby. Add empty floors up to F18. Build the lobby on F15. Add two express elevators will all eight cars each, set to wait 30 seconds, after offices 18 and 22. Build seven shopping floors with escalators on F11-F18. Add three more Recycling Centers on B4.\nBuild a second Skylobby on F30, with the same seven shopping floors from F26-F33, and new express elevators after offices 14 and 26. Make sure each pair of express elevators only stops at one of the Skylobbies. Add another three Recycling Centers on B4. Build a Metro Station on B4 near the right side escalator and add another escalator to connect it to the rest of the tower.\nAlmost done! You need one more shopping floor, but can\u0026rsquo;t build any more escalators. Add four elevator shafts around F15, on top of the hotel ones. Add four cars to each and set them to wait 30 seconds. Connect them to F19 and build your last shopping floor there.\nFinally, you can extend the middle two express elevators to floor 90, build a small Skylobby, build up to floor 100, add a Cathedral, build a two car elevator to get people from 90 to 100, and wait for the wedding.\nSave - Offices and $60M\nSave - Just Got TOWER\nRationale Why this design? Offices are a great source of income, and a two-star tower with stairs has zero expenses. After that, you need a lot of population and you need a reasonable income. Fast Food provides the best population-per-space, but the income is barely enough to cover lobby, express elevator, and escalator maintenance. Retail Shops have only slightly less population, but provide more than twice the income. A balance of 15 Fast Food and 10 Shops keeps your income reasonable and allows you to build 20 floors and 10 more Fast Food before hitting the 512 retail facility limit.\nPutting Security, Medical, and Parking on B1 avoids any elevator transportation and allows you to build only one ramp, with more than enough space left for the 10 Fast Food you need to hit 15,000 weekday population.\nYou only need two hotel suites, but I built a full single floor to generate a little more income while keeping the elevators very simple and avoiding a service elevator.\nTower Layout    Floors Facilities Pop $/Qtr [K]     31-33 Retail Shop x18, Fast Food x9 2,325 $855   30 Skylobby     26-29 Retail Shop x18, Fast Food x9 3,100 $1,140   19-25 Empty     16-18 Retail Shop x18, Fast Food x9 3,100 $1,140   15 Skylobby     11-14 15x Fast Food, 10x Retail Shop 3,100 $1,140   7-10 Empty     6 4x Housekeeping, 6x Hotel Suite, 40x Twin Room 92 $468   5 15x Fast Food, 10x Retail Shop 775 $285   2-4 40x Office 720 $1,200    Lobby     B1 2x Security, Medical, 10x Fast Food, 16x Parking Space, Ramp 350 $90   B2-B3 15x Fast Food, 10x Retail Shop 1,550 $570   B4-B6 8x Recycling Center, Metro Station      Total 15,112 $6,888    ","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/gaming/2021/03/12/return-to-simtower/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s 1994, and Maxis is a big name in gaming.

Retiring by 40 requires a very modest budget or very lucky circumstances (and we had some of both). Still, many people could retire much earlier than normal by budgeting, saving, and investing the way we did, and so we wanted to share our approach.\nHow We Did It So, how exactly did we go about all of this? I\u0026rsquo;ve written a series to go through the basic details.\n How to Budget and Save What to Save For How to Invest Retirement Account Types How Much You Need to Retire How Long It Will Take Getting Retirement Money Out  Our Story I got my first job in high school and quickly concluded that I wanted to retire as early as possible. I enjoyed my job, but I did not like the idea that my next life phase was decades of having to work to live. My wife and I met in college, and fortunately she was on board with the idea of early retirement.\nWe started tech jobs right out of college in 2002 and signed up to save 30% of our incomes in 401(k)s. Compared to our college lifestyle, the 70% of our income we had left still felt like a lot. The next year we decided to start saving up for a house, and we were shocked at how much money we would need. We realized that we needed to get even more serious about saving.\nWe tried different ways of budgeting and controlling our spending, but they all felt like scrimping and required too much tracking. Finally we found something that worked, and as the months went by our down payment started to pile up. We learned that we didn\u0026rsquo;t need a 20% down payment after all, and with our savings and some bonuses we bought a house in 2004.\nWe first redirected our savings to outfitting our house. Then, when the thirst of Target and Home Depot were finally slaked, we redirected it again, half to paying off our mortgage early and half toward retirement. We were growing at work and getting solid raises and promotions, but our budget kept us from automatically spending the extra money. We ended up keeping the same budget for ten years, directing all of our raises toward savings. In the end, we were saving close to 70% of our after tax income.\nIn late 2009 we paid off our house, and we redirected all of our savings to invest for retirement. It was a scary time to invest, but we believed the stock market would recover, and it did.\nIn 2014, we decided to try early retirement. We both quit work. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how to spend my time, and I found it hard to be home with small kids (then ages 3 and 1), so I ended up back at work after a year. My wife didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy being home alone and started working again another year later.\nIn 2020, with older kids, more hobbies, and more savings, we found a good moment and decided to retire again. It\u0026rsquo;s early days still for our second early retirement, but so far we\u0026rsquo;re keeping much busier and have been consistently enjoying it.\nAs I said, our very early retirement was the result of some very lucky circumstances - our parents supported us through college, we found high paying jobs we enjoyed, we were both naturally frugal, we started on this journey together very early, and houses were much more affordable when we bought ours. Still, even without those tailwinds, we still would likely have retired much earlier than normal.\n","permalink":"https://relentlessoptimizer.com/retire-early/","summary":"My wife and I retired just before turning 40, and here are the nuts and bolts of how we did it.","title":"How To Retire Early"}]
