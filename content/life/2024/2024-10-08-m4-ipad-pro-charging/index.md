title: "M4 iPad Pro 11 Charging"

I recently bought an M4 iPad Pro 11" and couldn't find detailed charging data about it. Here are my measurements.

I wanted to know:
- What is the maximum charging speed?
- How high does it charge at maximum speed?
- How long to 60%? 80%? 100%?

I tested with an [Anker Nano II 65w charger](https://www.anker.com/products/a2663) and my [Plugable USB-C power meter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5W5NKKN). 

I set the screen to never turn off so that I could see the exact battery level during charging. I used a black background and brightness was at about 30%. Wifi, Bluetooth, and Cellular were on with good signal strength.

I ran the iPad battery down until it turned off, and then recorded a video of it charging back up.

Here's what I saw:

| 0% -> | Time | End Watts |
| ----- | ---- | --------- |
| 20%   | 0:15 | 35w       |
| 40%   | 0:30 | 35w       |
| 55%   | 0:41 | 35w       |
| 60%   | 0:45 | 28w       |
| 75%   | 1:02 | 16w       |
| 80%   | 1:10 | 17w       |
| 90%   | 1:25 | 17w       |
| 95%   | 1:38 | 9w        |
| 100%  | 2:00 | -         |

The iPad charges at a max of 35w, which it maintains from 0-55%. After 55%, it slows to ~25w until 70%, and then ~17w until 90%. I didn't see the iPad draw more than 36w, even if I run a benchmark on it while the battery is under 50%. If you bring a 30w charger, you're getting just about maximum speed. 

Overall, charging from 0-60% is quick, taking only 45 minutes. Charging to 80% (1:10) or 90% (1:25) is still reasonably fast, but 90-100% is slower. If you turn on the 80% Limit, charging is relatively fast all the way until it stops.
