      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of the Starbucks Vanilla Sweet Cream cold brew since it came out, and a lover of cold brew coffee since the days before Seattle&amp;rsquo;s Best Coffee disappeared.</description>

      <description>When we got our first real jobs, we put our paychecks into our checking account and bought everything from there. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t be easier, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure many people do the same thing.</description>

      <description>I needed Windows to run SimTower, so I decided to try getting Win95 to run on DOSBox. The walkthroughs online had some skippable steps and I ran into some problems, and then I got distracted optimizing it.</description>

      <title>SimTower Max Tower</title>

      <description>A few days after my previous SimTower adventure, I wanted to revise my tower design. My retail-heavy-attempt was straightforward and didn&amp;rsquo;t take too many floors, but I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to try to build consistently all the way up to the 100th floor cathedral, and to try to max out many of the in-game limits right when I reached it.</description>

      <description>When playing through SimTower again, I was frequently looking for facts from the help and from online walkthroughs. Here&amp;rsquo;s a double-checked, complete set of the details I was looking for when replaying the game, with more useful details together in one place than the original help.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 1994, and Maxis is a big name in gaming. The excellent SimCity 2000 released last year, but we&amp;rsquo;re looking at a lesser known title, SimTower.</description>
