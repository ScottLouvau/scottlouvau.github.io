      <description>I love the tower defense game Kingdom Rush. More than anything else, it has just the right amount of complexity - just enough towers and abilities to give you options, and just enough tactical play to keep you busy between build steps.</description>

      <description>My Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 battery ran out on the first day by 4:00pm, and I was pretty disappointed. After a few device resets and a lot of measurements, however, my watch is now using only about a third of the battery per full 24 hour day.</description>

      <guid>https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/09/14/being-frugal-vs-being-cheap/</guid>
      <description>I used to think that &amp;ldquo;being frugal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;being cheap&amp;rdquo; were basically the same thing. Along my saving journey, however, I found out that the two are very different.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s surprising, but keeping food costs down was a big part of sticking to our budget and ultimately retiring early. Food is the third highest spending category for US households (after housing and transportation), so it&amp;rsquo;s a big part of most budgets.</description>

      <guid>https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/07/16/how-much-stock-vs-bonds/</guid>
      <description>How should you split your retirement investments between stock and bonds? How do you make this decision? Your chosen split is called your Asset Allocation, and you&amp;rsquo;ll often see it written as two numbers; for example, 60% stock and 40% bonds is written as &amp;ldquo;60/40&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>So, you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start saving for retirement. How much money will you need to save up?
TL;DR: You need about 25 times your retirement spending invested in a 50% stock / 50% bonds portfolio for a 30 year retirement.</description>

      <description>We retired early (the first time) in 2014 at age 33. Within two years, we were both back at work. After knowing what went wrong, we made adjustments, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that we retired again in 2020 and it&amp;rsquo;s been going much better.</description>

      <description>A few days after my previous SimTower adventure, I wanted to revise my tower design. My retail-heavy-attempt was straightforward and didn&amp;rsquo;t take too many floors, but I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to try to build consistently all the way up to the 100th floor cathedral, and to try to max out many of the in-game limits right when I reached it.</description>
