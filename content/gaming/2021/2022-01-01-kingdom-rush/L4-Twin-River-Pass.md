Twin River Pass is a step up in difficulty. The top of the map doesn't work as a single kill zone, because there aren't enough close tower positions. Instead, a left and right kill zone are needed, and they should be positioned where three or four towers can deal damage while soldiers block.

We will be using mages heavily in this map, so unlock the first two mage upgrades before this level, "Spell Reach" (range +10%) and "Arcane Shatter" (attacks damage armor). 

There are many Shamans on this map, but our mage towers don't hurt them much. We'll time our Rain of Fires to take them out. One Barracks per side is edgy, so we'll add reinforcements, alternating adding them to the left and right sides.
