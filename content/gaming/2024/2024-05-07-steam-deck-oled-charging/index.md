I've been really impressed by my new Steam Deck OLED. I was looking for some specific charging speed information online, but couldn't find it, so I measured myself.

Specifically, I wanted to know:
- How long does the Steam Deck charge at maximum speed?
- What is the "sweet spot" to charge the battery up to? 80%? 90%?
- How full is the battery when charging slows to 20w? 15w? 10w?
- How charged is the Deck when the LED turns green?

I used the included 45w charger and my [USB-C power meter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5W5NKKN), charged while the Deck was sleeping (rather than off), and turned the screen on every five minutes to check the charge percentage. I ran the Deck all the way down to start (until it turned off), so it was off for the first five minutes).

Here is a summary of charging times and speeds - the first two rows are the results after 30 and 60 minutes, and the rest are times to get to specific charge levels. 

| 0% -> | Time | End Watts |
| ----- | ---- | --------- |
| 37%   | 0:30 | 41w       |
| 72%   | 1:00 | 40w       |
| 80%   | 1:08 | 30w       |
| 85%   | 1:15 | 22w       |
| 90%   | 1:25 | 15w       |
| 95%   | 1:40 | 10w       |
| 100%  | 2:10 | -         |

If you're using a USB power meter to monitor charging, here is how charged the Deck is when the charging speed slows to different rates:

| Watts | %     |
| ----- | ----- |
| 41w   | 0-70% |
| 35w   | 76%   |
| 30w   | 80%   |
| 25w   | 83%   |
| 20w   | 86%   |
| 15w   | 90%   |
| 10w   | 95%   |
| 7w    | 97%   |
| 5w    | 99%   |

To answer my above questions:
#### How long does the Steam Deck charge at maximum speed?
The Steam Deck OLED charges at the maximum 41w from 0-70%, which it reaches in just under one hour.

#### What is the "sweet spot" to charge the battery up to?
I think waiting 1:15 for the battery to reach 85% is about ideal. Charging speeds are less than half of peak speeds above that.

#### How full is the battery when charging slows to 20w? 15w? 10w?
Charging slows to 20w at 86%, 15w at 90%, and 10w at 95%

#### How charged is the Deck when the LED turns green?
The Steam Deck OLED charging LED turns green when the battery is 95% charged, after which charging is very slow. It's another 30 minutes to reach 100%.
