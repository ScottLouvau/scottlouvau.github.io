Thieves and Wolves left and Spiders Right.

Thorns only? One kill zone in back or bottom left and top right? One zone top works. Artillery on top left is good (more hits as enemies escape and on thieves side)
Artillery at bottom position? (worked; hard to hold enemies, wastes provided tower, great for calling waves early.)

Poison for last wave (huge bandit guys). Two Mages between left paths worked, though maybe more money up top better.

700G start.
