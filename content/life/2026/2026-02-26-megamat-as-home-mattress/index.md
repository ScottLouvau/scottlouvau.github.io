title: "MegaMat as a Home Mattress"

My wife and I weren't sleeping well. Our mattress, only four years old, required rotation every few weeks and quickly developed a "dent" where my hip sits that was too deep. My wife and I prefer different firmness levels, and different levels of warmth from our bedding. We knew it was time to make our sleep setup "just right" for each of us separately, but the ~$1,600 minimum cost of an adjustable mattresses was unappealing.

While procrastinating on that, I decided to see if I could sleep better on a sleeping pad on the floor. I'd never slept especially well on any of our camping pads, but I wasn't sleeping well anyway. I figured I could try to find "just right" for my bedding warmth and the pad inflation. 

I set up our most plush, comfortable pad, bought originally for camping in our car. I tried laying on my side and stomach (as I do when sleeping) to see if I could get the inflation right. Once I thought it was good, I tried several nights on it, to see if I would acclimate to it. I didn't - my Apple Watch showed lots of sleep interruptions, and that's how I felt.

I wasn't quite ready to give up, though, so I decided to try systematically testing inflation levels. The pad, an [Exped MegaMat](https://www.expedusa.com/products/megamat?variant=47704145363161), comes with a small hand pump. I started at the "neutral inflation" level it settles at when left with the valves open. I then tested five pumps more each night, with very good results at +10 and +15 pumps.

After a week of testing different levels and learning to pay more attention to my spine when awake, I had my first few nights with no aching back and very high sleep scores. Awesome! 

I need a level which works on my side and stomach. On my side, my hip needs to sink so that my spine isn't curved sideways too much. On my stomach, my stomach needs to sink so that my back isn't too curved or too flat. It turned out that N+11 pumps worked for both. 

As it happens, the [MegaMat Long X-Wide](https://www.expedusa.com/products/megamat?variant=47704145363161) is almost perfectly half of a queen frame, at 77.6" long by 30.3" wide (vs 80" x 60" for a queen). We found them on sale at REI for $200 (vs $280 MSRP) and bought two to put side-by-side in our bedframe. Underneath, we have a layer of plywood for full support, and a layer of EVA foam tiles (like gym floor mats) to protect the pads from splinters and be softer if we "bottom out".

We've now slept on the new setup for three months. My sleep isn't consistently great yet. I still need to avoid late-night carbs and get my hydration right. However, I never wake up with my lower back aching anymore, and I no longer roll from side to side when reading because my back starts to hurt. I had my first perfect sleep score night on the pad.

Like an adjustable mattress, we can each now set a separate firmness. The pads are isolated enough that we don't feel each other moving at night. We can incline each side separately with extra foam mat layers underneath.

The sleeping pads have some unique advantages, too. We brought them on our last long weekend trip, and replicated our home sleeping setup where we were staying. Our next camping trip should be the most comfortable we've ever had.

We don't know how long the pads will last, but Exped has a [five year warranty](https://www.expedusa.com/pages/warranty-and-repairs). They don't have springs or thick foam layers that will wear out over time. The two pads were also only 1/4 of the price of a "base model" adjustable mattress. We got 4" thick MegaMats, which are enough for me on my side, but the 6" thick MegaMat Max might also be worth a look.

If you're struggling to get the right bed firmness, or just never sleep well when camping, getting a nice sleeping pad and systematically testing inflation might be worth a try!
