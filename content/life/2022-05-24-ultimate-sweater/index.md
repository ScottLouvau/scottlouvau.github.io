title: "Search for the Ultimate Indoor Sweater"

For most of my life, I've bought clothes on sale which seemed "good enough". My outerwear lasts a really long time, though. As a few favorites finally wore out, I decided that I should really just spend the money to get exactly what I want and get rid of the rest. With that, my quest for some perfect sweaters began.

## Goals

After so many years of picking things off the sale rack, it was satisfying to think about what I really want in a sweater and what I've liked in my recent favorites. Overall, my goal is to find three sweaters which are ideal for indoor use, outdoors in very mild (65-75F) temperatures, or for layering under a jacket. In addition, I want:

**Fleece**
I wore soft shells everywhere for a long time, but didn't like that I would get sweaty indoors if it was too warm, that they made noise every time I shifted in my chair, and that people would sometimes ask if I need a place to "hang up my jacket". Fleece sweaters fix all of this - they are breathable enough so I won't sweat unless I'm way too hot, are quiet when I move around, and are socially appropriate to wear indoors. Cotton often feels cold when I first put it on, and gets and stays a lot wetter in rain. 

**Warm**
Ultimately, I want my sweaters for indoor use first. My office can be 65-72F or so, so I want something which is great over a shirt in that whole range. I am usually cold, so this means a mid- to heavyweight fleece.

**Full Zip**
I hate when pullovers try to pull my shirt off as I remove them. A full zip is also great to wear fully unzipped when it would otherwise be too warm to keep it on.

**No Hood**
I want a hood for outdoor warmth, but for an indoor-first item, I don't want a lump when I lean back on a chair and want something easy to pull another layer over.

**Relaxed Fit, Hip Length, Long Enough Sleeves**
I want a sweater that fully covers my waist and wrists. I've had too many sweaters that were a bit too short and I want something that really feels the right size.

**Durable**
I'm willing to spend for a nice sweater, but want it to last a decade or longer. It shouldn't pill or wear through too quickly.

**Coordinated and Fashionable**
I'm too lazy to make sure my clothing colors match and my clothes aren't too fancy or casual for whatever I'll be doing. Instead, I'd rather pick colors so that all of my sweaters look ok with all of my pants, and they are casual enough for a beach and nice enough for a moderately fancy restaurant. A knit exterior seems to work for this, though this goes against my durability goal.

## Winners

[KUIU Base Camp Full Zip](https://www.kuiu.com/products/base-camp-full-zip-sweater-charcoal) | $100 | 21 oz
When shopping for a great backpacking mid-layer, I stumbled upon KUIU. I got the "Base Camp" sweater because it was relatively cheap on sale and it quickly became my favorite. It's just the right warmth, a comfortable fit, and I like the look. It pills a lot, especially on the bottoms of the sleeves, so durability is a concern. I got a "sweater shaver" and shaved the pills off, and it's looking nice again. Mine is hooded, but since I already have it, I'm keeping it until it wears out.

[Patagonia Better Sweater Fleece Jacket](https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-better-sweater-fleece-jacket/25528.html?dwvar_25528_color=STH) | $140 | 21 oz
My previous favorite was a (hooded) Better Sweater, which somehow I lost. It had the same nice knit exterior, perfect warmth, and great fit. I bought an unhooded one to replace it. I especially like that the sleeves articulate well - when I raise my arms overhead, the bottom of the sweater doesn't ride up much. The collar for the unhooded version feels a bit tall, but otherwise it's great.

[REI Hyperaxis 2.0](https://www.rei.com/product/166946/rei-co-op-hyperaxis-fleece-jacket-20-mens) | $130 | 17 oz
As I was trying on my candidates at REI, the Hyperaxis caught my eye, so I decided to try it on and immediately loved it. It's made of Polartec Power Stretch Pro, which is warmer than I expect for the weight. The Hyperaxis has a hood, but the material is thin enough I think it might sit flat out of the way. It does not have a knit face, so it looks more casual, but it might also be a lot more durable than my knit choices.

## Close Contenders

[Arc'teryx Covert Cardigan](https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/covert-cardigan) | $180
The Covert Cardigan is extremely similar to the Better Sweater. I think it's got a slightly nicer cut (particularly at the shoulders), with a trimmer but still comfortable fit. The collar doesn't feel too tall, but the arm articulation isn't as good as the Better Sweater. I ultimately kept the Better Sweater instead, but if you want a slimmer fit or like the cut, this is a good option.

[Arc'teryx Kyanite AR](https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/kyanite-ar-jacket) | $160
The Kyanite, like the Hyperaxis, is made from Polartec Power Stretch Pro, so it doesn't have the nice knit look, but is likely to be much more durable. I couldn't find it in store to try out.

[Kuhl Interceptr](https://www.kuhl.com/kuhl/mens/outerwear/interceptr-pro-fz/) | $130
The Interceptr looks and feels great, but was a much slimmer fit with relatively tight sleeves, so it didn't meet my "relaxed fit" criterion. If you want a slim fit, however, it seems like a great option.

[REI Groundbreaker 2.0](https://www.rei.com/product/177504/rei-co-op-groundbreaker-fleece-jacket-20-mens) | $50 | 13 oz
The Groundbreaker has a soft, "traditional fleece" exterior rather than a knitted one. It also seems to catch on my inner layers more as I'm trying to take it off. Since it was $35 (!!) during the REI Spring Sale, I picked one up to be a potential "at home" sweater.

## Other Possibles

[Rab Quest Fleece Jacket](https://rab.equipment/us/quest-jacket) | $100
[Outdoor Research Vigor Plus Jacket](https://www.outdoorresearch.com/us/shop-by-activity/mens-vigor-plus-fleece-jacket-283183) | $150

## Conclusion

It hasn't been long yet, but going down from about ten "pretty good" sweaters to three great ones which go with everything else I have has been really nice. I put three hooks next to my bed, and once I'm dressed I can get a sweater picked and on in about two seconds. My frugal instincts struggled to buy these things at full price, but if I really stick with them for ten years, it will end up cheaper than cycling through "pretty good" $25 Costco options which have never been perfect. I've had the Base Camp for almost a year, and had the old Better Sweater for about that long before I lost it, so I'm hopeful. We'll see.
