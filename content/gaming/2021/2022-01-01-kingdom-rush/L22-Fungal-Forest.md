This is one of the hardest levels for me, especially on Heroic and Iron. Strong enemies come from everywhere, though the strongest ones come from the top and go through the middle path.

Bring Buzzsaw to block and insta-kill enemies. Use Tesla towers with L3 Overcharge to manage the Husks and Creepers. Once you have two Tesla towers on each path, the Rotshrooms also won't be able to get through. These combine nicely with the Sorcerer Towers, which provide four useful benefits here: their attack causes damage over time for the Husks and halves armor for the Treants, transmute takes out Swamp Things, and and Earth Elementals provide late game blocking.

| Enemy           | HP    | Speed  | Armor  | Mag. Def. | Gold | Damage | sec/hit   |
| --------------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | --------- | ---- | ------ | --------- |
| Husk            | 250   | Slow   | Medium | None      | 10   | 5-15   | 1.0       |
| Noxious Creeper | 1,000 | Slow   | None   | Medium    | 40   | 20-40  | 1.0       |
| Rotshroom       | 500   | Medium | None   | None      | 20   | 12-18  | 1.0       |
| Tainted Treant  | 1,000 | Medium | High   | None      | 60   | 20-40  | 1.0       |
| Swamp Thing     | 3,000 | Medium | None   | None      | 200  | 40-100 | 2.5 / 2.1 |

For Heroic, use a similar layout. Start with the bottom Sorcerer, then the Tesla towers: bottom, right, left, and middle. Add the upper Sorcerer and lower left and right at the end. Add each tower after the previous one has been upgraded to  Overcharge L3 or Transmute L1.
