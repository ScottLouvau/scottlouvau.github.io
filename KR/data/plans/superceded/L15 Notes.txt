Rotten Forest
=============
Tesl on B2, then D4 seem good. Want two for better crowd management.
Rang on E5 w/Pois is very useful for flying out of top right.

Sorc on B5 to cut shields.
Musk on B7, E7 for instant kills, then boss damage.
Arca on B9, E1, then G1 for instant kills and Treant softening.

Could also try Tesl on B2, B5, Sorc on D4.
Rang on F4 would better hit bottom right and engage in main zone, but early poisoning of top routes seems more important.

Could try switch to Arca in back with Teleport, or 3x Tesl.
Need to find out if Tesla overcharge damage stacks.
===
First playthrough managed groups better.
Second managed big enemies better.
Early group handling useful for last wave.
