We want the full $4,000 benefit from the two child tax credits, which are not fully refundable, which means at least $61,725 in ordinary income ($25,100 standard deduction + $19,750 x 10% + $16,875 x 12% = $4,000 tax). After that, another $44,425 of qualified income (qualified dividends or long term capital gains) are also tax free.</p><p>However, our maximum tax free income of $106,150 goes over the income where ACA subsidies disappear, which is $104,800 (400% of the Federal Poverty Level or FPL).</p><p>With our taxable account interest and dividends, we can Roth convert about $52,000 per year with no tax cost other than a reduced ACA subsidy, which is effectively a 9.83% tax and a good deal to us.</p><p>However, after reading an <a href=https://www.kitces.com/blog/the-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-tax-credits-stimulus-checks-and-more-that-advisors-need-to-know/>excellent summary of the American Rescue Plan</a>, I found out that things will be a lot different for 2021 and 2022.</p><p>First, the child tax credit is <strong>fully refundable</strong>, so we no longer need a particular minimum income to fully use the child tax credit.</p><p>Second, the ACA Premium Assistance Tax Credit (PATC, or &ldquo;ACA subsidy&rdquo; below) will be larger for 2021 and 2022. There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;premium percentage&rdquo; of your income that ACA expects you to pay for health care, but then the subsidy covers the rest of the cost of your local &ldquo;benchmark plan&rdquo;. These premium percentages are <strong>much lower</strong> for 2021 and 2022 at a wide range of income levels. Using the <a href=https://aspe.hhs.gov/2020-poverty-guidelines>2020 Federal Poverty Levels</a>:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Income [% of FPL]</th><th>Income [Family of 4]</th><th>2021-2022 Premium Percentage</th><th>&lsquo;Normal&rsquo; Premium Percentage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&lt; 133%</td><td>&lt; $34,846</td><td>0.00%</td><td>2.07%</td></tr><tr><td>133%</td><td>$34,846</td><td>0.00%</td><td>3.10%</td></tr><tr><td>150%</td><td>$39,300</td><td>0.00%</td><td>4.14%</td></tr><tr><td>200%</td><td>$52,400</td><td><strong>2.00%</strong></td><td>6.52%</td></tr><tr><td>250%</td><td>$65,500</td><td><strong>4.00%</strong></td><td>8.33%</td></tr><tr><td>300%</td><td>$78,600</td><td>6.00%</td><td>9.83%</td></tr><tr><td>350%</td><td>$91,700</td><td>7.25%</td><td>9.83%</td></tr><tr><td>400%</td><td>$104,800</td><td>8.50%</td><td>9.83%</td></tr><tr><td>> 400%</td><td>> $104,800</td><td><strong>8.50%</strong></td><td>N/A (no subsidy)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Together, these two changes mean that a much lower target income is best, because we aren&rsquo;t losing part of the child tax credit and the ACA subsidy decreases much more quickly as our income increases, acting like a higher marginal tax than normal.</p><p>In our case, it looks like our income for the next two years should be about <strong>$72,000</strong> (275% of FPL), which is the maximum income at which our (bronze plan) ACA premiums are fully reimbursed.</p><p>This will mean doing a $22,000 smaller Roth conversion. Normally that would only save us $2,162 in ACA subsidies (9.83%), in which case we&rsquo;d rather stick with the bigger Roth conversion. For 2021 and 2022, however, it&rsquo;ll save $2,640 in federal tax (we&rsquo;re not losing any child tax credit) and a <strong>stonking $5,600</strong> in ACA subsidies, for a total of <strong>$8,240</strong>, almost four times the normal benefit.</p><p>If you receive the child tax credit, buy healthcare from the ACA exchanges, and have control over your taxable income, it&rsquo;s worth looking to see if you should have a different plan for this year and next.</p><p>A few more notes for 2021 and 2022:</p><ul><li>Stimulus checks are officially based on 2021 income, but will be sent based on your latest taxes filed when the IRS initially processes the payments. You don&rsquo;t have to pay them back if your 2019 or 2020 taxes triggered a higher payment than your 2021 income would qualify for. You may want to delay filing taxes if your 2019 income was lower than 2020.</li><li>Watch out for the $150,000 income level (MFJ) because any stimulus payment and the extra child tax credit very rapidly phase out.</li><li>The ACA PATC is <strong>not</strong> limited to incomes under 400% of FPL, though your subsidy shrinks as you&rsquo;re expected to pay 8.5% of your income toward the benchmark healthcare plan.</li><li>There are also dependent care account, COBRA, unemployment assistance, and tuition debt</li></ul></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=/finance/2021/03/30/how-we-budget/><span class=title>« Previous Post</span><br><span>How We Budget</span></a>
