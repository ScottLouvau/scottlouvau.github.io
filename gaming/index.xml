      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was delighted to play some of my old DOS favorites on my Steam Deck, but quickly ran into a number of problems with the EmuDeck &amp;gt; RetroArch &amp;gt; DOSBox-Pure path. After trying the various options, I found a setup that works well and wanted to document it here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy playing Wordle and optimizing my play. &lt;a href=&#34;https://relentlessoptimizer.com/gaming/2023/06/08/my-best-wordle-guesses/&#34;&gt;Initially&lt;/a&gt; that meant choosing the best starting guesses, but I have also worked on &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; I play the games. I originally tried to solve the puzzles in my head, but quickly found that I play much better on paper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been really impressed by my new Steam Deck OLED. I was looking for some specific charging speed information online, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it, so I measured myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week on &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;, someone &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39136123&#34;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new Wordle variant, &lt;a href=&#34;https://qwertle.friedman.in/&#34;&gt;QWERTLE&lt;/a&gt;. As an avid Wordle player and optimizer, I was excited to try playing and solving this new game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a &lt;a href=&#34;https://i-kh.net/2022/04/22/my-lazy-wordle-strategy/&#34;&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/09/14/this-is-the-best-wordle-starting-word-according-to-mit-researchers.html&#34;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;best first Wordle guesses&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://betterprogramming.pub/forget-luck-optimized-wordle-strategy-using-bigquery-c676771e316f&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://jonathanolson.net/experiments/optimal-wordle-solutions&#34;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, but while they may provide the most theoretical information, I had trouble using them as a human. Here are my adventures coming up with the best starting words for my own play style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimizing Kingdom Rush</title>
      <link>https://relentlessoptimizer.com/gaming/2022/02/16/optimizing-kingdom-rush/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love the tower defense game Kingdom Rush. More than anything else, it has just the right amount of complexity - just enough towers and abilities to give you options, and just enough tactical play to keep you busy between build steps. The difficulty rises smoothly across the levels, slowly asking more of you as you improve. It&amp;rsquo;s great fun and has massive replayability. Thanks to a vibrant community, YouTube walkthroughs are there to help if you get stuck or need new strategic ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest in my series of game replays is Batman: Arkham Asylum, thanks to a recent GOG Sale that had it going for $5.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quest for Glory I</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quest for Glory 1 is one of my favorite role-playing games, and one of the first I played. Sierra walked the line between adventure and puzzle games beautifully in the series, making something that still feels unique. Ultimately, though, what keeps bringing me back is the setting and the story, told with impressive graphics, great music, and witty dialog that still hold up well so many years later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Win95 on DOSBox</title>
      <link>https://relentlessoptimizer.com/gaming/2021/03/25/win95-on-dosbox/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I needed Windows to run SimTower, so I decided to try getting Win95 to run on DOSBox. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://dosbox95.darktraveler.com/guide%20select.html&#34;&gt;walkthroughs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://dsync.blogspot.com/2014/03/a-complete-guide-to-install-windows-95.html&#34;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; had some skippable steps and I ran into some problems, and then I got distracted optimizing it.. Anyway, here are my terse, working steps for getting very nice Win95 DOSBox images.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SimTower Max Tower</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days after my &lt;a href=&#34;https://relentlessoptimizer.com/gaming/2021/03/12/return-to-simtower/&#34;&gt;previous SimTower adventure&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to revise my tower design. My retail-heavy-attempt was straightforward and didn&amp;rsquo;t take too many floors, but I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to try to build consistently all the way up to the 100th floor cathedral, and to try to max out many of the in-game limits right when I reached it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When playing through SimTower again, I was frequently looking for facts from the help and from online walkthroughs. Here&amp;rsquo;s a double-checked, complete set of the details I was looking for when replaying the game, with more useful details together in one place than the original help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Return to SimTower</title>
      <link>https://relentlessoptimizer.com/gaming/2021/03/12/return-to-simtower/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 1994, and Maxis is a big name in gaming. The excellent SimCity 2000 released last year, but we&amp;rsquo;re looking at a lesser known title, SimTower. SimTower was not actually developed by Maxis, but instead by Yoot Saito, who was inspired by the 1989 SimCity. The game was released as &amp;ldquo;The Tower&amp;rdquo; in Japan and was relatively successful. Maxis learned about the game and offered to publish it in the US, branded as a &amp;ldquo;Sim&amp;rdquo;-title.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
