      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I started a Bluray collection after watching a &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/GdQ5bClEgHg&#34;&gt;Linus Tech Tips video&lt;/a&gt; about it. I&amp;rsquo;m frustrated about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cabletv.com/news/streaming-service-price-increases&#34;&gt;rapidly rising cost of streaming services&lt;/a&gt;. For 4K ad-free service, between 2019 and 2026, Disney+ went from &lt;strong&gt;$7/mo&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;$19/mo&lt;/strong&gt;, and Netflix went from &lt;strong&gt;$14/mo&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;$25/mo&lt;/strong&gt;. On my &amp;ldquo;ad-free&amp;rdquo; subscriptions, sometimes I see ads anyway. I&amp;rsquo;ve read horror stories about losing &amp;ldquo;bought&amp;rdquo; media if the service cancels your account someday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Travel Loadout in a 12L Daypack</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love traveling light and the one bag concept, but had never actually fit everything into a single bag. I’m picky about certain items - I want my iPad setup, ice water in a vacuum bottle, and my Sonicare toothbrush. On past trips, I learned I also needed a good daypack - two comfortable straps, back ventilation, and some internal structure. I didn’t think a daypack would fit in another bag, so I figured I was stuck with a rolling suitcase plus daypack. Then, on my last trip, I got some great quick-drying clothes and tried out “hotel sink laundry”, and found that it worked! Everything was dry by morning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was delighted to play some of my old DOS favorites on my Steam Deck, but quickly ran into a number of problems with the EmuDeck &amp;gt; RetroArch &amp;gt; DOSBox-Pure path. After trying the various options, I found a setup that works well and wanted to document it here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy playing Wordle and optimizing my play. &lt;a href=&#34;https://relentlessoptimizer.com/gaming/2023/06/08/my-best-wordle-guesses/&#34;&gt;Initially&lt;/a&gt; that meant choosing the best starting guesses, but I have also worked on &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; I play the games. I originally tried to solve the puzzles in my head, but quickly found that I play much better on paper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been really impressed by my new Steam Deck OLED. I was looking for some specific charging speed information online, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it, so I measured myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week on &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;, someone &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39136123&#34;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new Wordle variant, &lt;a href=&#34;https://qwertle.friedman.in/&#34;&gt;QWERTLE&lt;/a&gt;. As an avid Wordle player and optimizer, I was excited to try playing and solving this new game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I originally wrote the C# version of this code to write a performance tuning &lt;a href=&#34;https://relentlessoptimizer.com/code/2022/08/10/performance-tuning-from-1.5m-to-50m-datetimes-parsed-per-second-in-c/&#34;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for DateTime parsing. I came back after learning some Rust to try to compare the performance of the two languages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a &lt;a href=&#34;https://i-kh.net/2022/04/22/my-lazy-wordle-strategy/&#34;&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/09/14/this-is-the-best-wordle-starting-word-according-to-mit-researchers.html&#34;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;best first Wordle guesses&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://betterprogramming.pub/forget-luck-optimized-wordle-strategy-using-bigquery-c676771e316f&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://jonathanolson.net/experiments/optimal-wordle-solutions&#34;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, but while they may provide the most theoretical information, I had trouble using them as a human. Here are my adventures coming up with the best starting words for my own play style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do the laundry in our house, and it often takes most of a day because I don&amp;rsquo;t hear the dryer finish. I set a timer on my phone, but it&amp;rsquo;s often not done when I go check on it. Today Darinee and I finally implemented a &amp;ldquo;Dryer is done&amp;rdquo; notification on my phone, so I&amp;rsquo;ll know exactly when it&amp;rsquo;s time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We recently set up Wireguard as a home VPN. It&amp;rsquo;s widely used, trusted, open source, and free, but I stumbled on a few things along the way and the documentation is sparse, so I wanted to write up what I did.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Aurora Projector Wi-Fi IR Remote</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note: This is the first guest post from my wife, Darinee!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our neighbor gave the kids a couple of light projectors for Christmas, a galaxy one and an aurora one.  They project red, green, blue, and white lights to the ceiling in very organic ways.  They&amp;rsquo;re very cool!  I have since conscripted the aurora projector for the living room.  The projector came with a remote control to adjust things like color, speed, and the stars.  However, who wants another IR remote to store and keep track of?  Not me!  So, I created a WiFi IR remote which I connected with Home Assistant so I can control the projector from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love the Visual Studio C# Performance Profiler, and am shocked to find out how many engineers around me haven&amp;rsquo;t used it before. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to quickly check the performance of your code and you&amp;rsquo;d be amazed how often there are significant performance bottlenecks there that are very easy to fix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For most of my life, I&amp;rsquo;ve bought clothes on sale which seemed &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo;. My outerwear lasts a really long time, though. As a few favorites finally wore out, I decided that I should really just get exactly what I want and get rid of the rest. With that, my quest for some perfect sweaters began.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started using an M1 MacBook Pro 14&amp;quot;. I wanted to know which of my cables and chargers work with it and how fast it charges from them. My previous laptop, an ASUS Zephyrus G14, only charges from 20v (60w+) USB-C chargers, so I was expecting the same. I was shocked to find out that the MacBook will charge from &lt;strong&gt;every charger I have&lt;/strong&gt;, at any voltage!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love the tower defense game Kingdom Rush. More than anything else, it has just the right amount of complexity - just enough towers and abilities to give you options, and just enough tactical play to keep you busy between build steps. The difficulty rises smoothly across the levels, slowly asking more of you as you improve. It&amp;rsquo;s great fun and has massive replayability. Thanks to a vibrant community, YouTube walkthroughs are there to help if you get stuck or need new strategic ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ScottLouvau/RegexBuilder/releases/tag/v2.10&#34;&gt;releasing&lt;/a&gt; a new version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ScottLouvau/RegexBuilder&#34;&gt;Regex Builder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;14 years&lt;/strong&gt; after the previous release, thanks to an email from a fan. Regular Expressions (regexes) are a powerful way to search text, but also hard to write and &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; hard to debug, kind of like SQL queries. I wrote Regex Builder originally around 2004 (!!) to help me to iterate on regexes more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 battery ran out on the first day by 4:00pm, and I was pretty disappointed. After a few device resets and a lot of measurements, however, my watch is now using only about a third of the battery per full 24 hour day. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 recently came out, and it inspired me to try going phone-free, carrying only the watch. I spend too much time glued to my phone, and I wanted to take back my attention, but I know I need to be reachable. For me, the core problem is the endless scrolling apps - Reddit, YouTube, Google News, and a few pages-of-links websites I obsessively visit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/09/14/being-frugal-vs-being-cheap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to think that &amp;ldquo;being frugal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;being cheap&amp;rdquo; were basically the same thing. Along my saving journey, however, I found out that the two are very different. To me, In a nutshell, &amp;ldquo;being cheap&amp;rdquo; means trying to spend as little as possible and &amp;ldquo;being frugal&amp;rdquo; means to spend as thoughtfully as possible. What do those concepts really mean?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s surprising, but keeping food costs down was a big part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/06/09/how-we-kept-the-same-budget-for-eight-years/&#34;&gt;sticking to our budget&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately &lt;a href=&#34;https://relentlessoptimizer.com/retire-early/&#34;&gt;retiring early&lt;/a&gt;. Food is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/consumer-expenditures/2019/home.htm&#34;&gt;third highest&lt;/a&gt; spending category for US households (after housing and transportation), so it&amp;rsquo;s a big part of most budgets. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to change your food choices than to move to a new house or car, so if you want to save more, it&amp;rsquo;s a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Our Retirement Withdrawal Plan</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After you retire, you need to decide how much you can spend each year, which investments to take the money from, and when to rebalance your investments. Collectively, this is called your &amp;ldquo;withdrawal plan&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How should you split your &lt;a href=&#34;https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/05/26/how-to-invest/&#34;&gt;retirement investments&lt;/a&gt; between stock and bonds? How do you make this decision? Your chosen split is called your Asset Allocation, and you&amp;rsquo;ll often see it written as two numbers; for example, 60% stock and 40% bonds is written as &amp;ldquo;60/40&amp;rdquo;. Let&amp;rsquo;s dig into it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain how we accomplished that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

When I first heard that number, I thought saving that much would take forever. Fortunately, there are two giant tailwinds to help: &lt;strong&gt;compounding returns&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;decreasing spending&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start saving for retirement. How much money will you need to save up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: You need about 25 times your &lt;strong&gt;retirement spending&lt;/strong&gt; invested in a &lt;strong&gt;50% stock / 50% bonds&lt;/strong&gt; portfolio for a &lt;strong&gt;30 year retirement&lt;/strong&gt;. Put another way, you can spend about 4% of your initial portfolio balance per year. For a 50+ year retirement, plan on 3.5% (or save 28.5 times your spending) and have 60-75% stock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently decided to make a local and second-cloud backup of our digital photos, and decided to see if I could optimize them in the process. I figured our phones would produce decently optimized JPG photos directly, but it turns out that a quick pass with an optimization tool reduced the sizes by half with no difference that I could perceive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Five mistakes we made during our first Early Retirement</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We retired early (the first time) in 2014 at age 33. Within two years, we were both back at work. After knowing what went wrong, we made adjustments, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that we retired again in 2020 and it&amp;rsquo;s been going much better. Without further ado, here are five things we did wrong (and five we did right) in our first retirement attempt:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quest for Glory 1 is one of my favorite role-playing games, and one of the first I played. Sierra walked the line between adventure and puzzle games beautifully in the series, making something that still feels unique. Ultimately, though, what keeps bringing me back is the setting and the story, told with impressive graphics, great music, and witty dialog that still hold up well so many years later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What To Save For</title>
      <link>https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/04/13/what-to-save-for/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/04/13/what-to-save-for/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://relentlessoptimizer.com/finance/2021/03/30/how-we-budget/&#34;&gt;made a budget&lt;/a&gt; and now you&amp;rsquo;re starting to save. What should you do with the money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit Card debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emergency Fund (one month of expenses)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Non-Mortgage Debt (car loan, student loans)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some Retirement Saving (get employer match)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future Big Purchases (house, trip, car, kid college)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More Retirement Saving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audacious Goals: House Payoff, Early Retirement, Year off from Work, &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, if you have any &lt;strong&gt;credit card debt&lt;/strong&gt;, pay it off. Put the credit cards away so you stop using them. Pay with a debit card instead. I know, debit cards don&amp;rsquo;t have rewards and fraud protection. But if you&amp;rsquo;re in debt, stopping the bank from taking your money every month in interest matters much more than the value of credit card rewards and the potential risk of losing some to fraud.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of the Starbucks Vanilla Sweet Cream cold brew since it came out and a lover of cold brew coffee since the days before Seattle&amp;rsquo;s Best Coffee disappeared. I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to buy coffee out every day, so I learned to make cold brew at home and mix reasonable replicas of my Seattle&amp;rsquo;s Best iced mocha and the Vanilla Sweet Cream between coffee outings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we got our first real jobs, we put our paychecks into our checking account and bought everything from there. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t be easier, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure many people do the same thing. The problem was that while we didn&amp;rsquo;t spend more than we had, we also weren&amp;rsquo;t saving up anything. When we wanted to take a vacation, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear how we would pay for it. When we had an unexpected expense (a gift for someone, a car repair, or whatever) our account would be knocked down and we&amp;rsquo;d have to cut back for a while to try to refill it. It felt like we were constantly being knocked off track and forced to make cuts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Anyway, here are my terse, working steps for getting very nice Win95 DOSBox images.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My retail-heavy-attempt was straightforward and didn&amp;rsquo;t take too many floors, but I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to try to build consistently all the way up to the 100th floor cathedral, and to try to max out many of the in-game limits right when I reached it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 1994, and Maxis is a big name in gaming. The excellent SimCity 2000 released last year, but we&amp;rsquo;re looking at a lesser known title, SimTower. SimTower was not actually developed by Maxis, but instead by Yoot Saito, who was inspired by the 1989 SimCity. The game was released as &amp;ldquo;The Tower&amp;rdquo; in Japan and was relatively successful. Maxis learned about the game and offered to publish it in the US, branded as a &amp;ldquo;Sim&amp;rdquo;-title.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How To Retire Early</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My wife and I retired just before turning 40, and here are the nuts and bolts of how we did it. Retiring by 40 requires a very modest budget or very lucky circumstances (and we had some of both). Still, many people could retire much earlier than normal by budgeting, saving, and investing the way we did, and so we wanted to share our approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love Kingdom Rush, so I built a syntax for transcribing games, an animator to efficiently show a game plan, and an AI Scanner to transcribe my games from video recordings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;kingdom-rush-syntax&#34;&gt;Kingdom Rush Syntax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingdom Rush syntax is used to write a plan for how to play a given level, the same way that Chess Algebra is used to document chess games. The syntax has a &lt;strong&gt;long form&lt;/strong&gt;, intended for human use, and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://relentlessoptimizer.com/KR/help/#short-syntax&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;short form&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for computers (in URLs or stored in JSON, for example).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pacifica Camping Build</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We wanted to be able to sleep in our Pacifica, and for it to be more comfortable and faster to get to bed and get going than a random motel. We&amp;rsquo;re picky sleepers and need our room to be dark, quiet, cool, and the bed to be right. Most motels don&amp;rsquo;t have all of these things right, so we usually don&amp;rsquo;t sleep especially well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We wanted to camp overnight in our 2018 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid. If the van is plugged in or the battery is charged enough, the climate system can run overnight without the engine turning on. Unfortunately, the van turns itself off after 30 minutes if left in Park (or while charging).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
