title: "COVID Road Trip: An Unexpected Journey"

After a year with no travel (2020) and a year of road trips only (2021), we decided this year to get back to air travel. We flew to New York City to explore and visit some family, and midway through the trip I got COVID. My family, who had gotten Omicron in January, seemed like they would stay well, but on the day they were scheduled to fly home, one of my daughters tested positive, too.

Our original hotel was very supportive, but our reservation was ending and we didn't want to stay longer in Times Square. I had booked another hotel until I could return, but when I called to get a larger room, they cancelled our reservation. The NY Department of Health no longer had a "hotels for isolation" program and said our likely only option was to book a hotel without telling them. We didn't want to do that, and couldn't fly, so we decided to rent a car and road trip our way home.

We couldn't stay at hotels along the way, of course, so we camped our way home, two in the car and two in a tent. We didn't have any supplies, so we stopped at a few Walmarts on the way. We didn't want to get anything fancy, since we already have nice camping gear, so we got a $30 kids backyard tent, some $12 sleeping bags, and a $10 pocketknife. Walmart didn't have any appealing sleeping pads, so we got a few extra sleeping bags to sleep on top of. 

It was definitely the most minimal camping gear we've ever camped with, and while the first night was rough (three and four hours of sleep, according to our FitBits) we slept pretty well on the second night and fine by the third. We had one headlamp with us, and converted a phone into a lantern by putting a puffed up white plastic bag on top of it. 

Driving in New York and New Jersey was unpleasant - sudden lane changes, passing on the left and right, and not well centered in their lanes - but after that, the rural drivers were very courteous, moving over to let people pass and generally each driving at a consistent speed. There were also toll roads everywhere, and while we thought the rental car was equipped for electronic tolling, we have to wait and see what charges we get.

We were amazed at how green most of the East Coast is. We expected the same brown hills that California has, but the highways were lined by bright green, round-topped trees until the Midwest, where that gave way to endless farms. It wasn't until about Montana that we saw the familiar mix of green and brown and the pointy evergreens we're used to at home.

We left around noon on the 12th, and made it back just before midnight on the 15th. We drove more each day, usually getting to a campground around dusk (9:00pm) to find a site and set up. Since the trip was mid-week, we never had trouble finding a site, and never had to go on to another campground. We're used to just finding a site and paying the next morning when arriving late, but in Wisconsin there was a web-based way to pay and we learned we should've paid online. Fortunately we were able to call and fix things in the morning. On the last day, the 15th, we started driving from Spearfish, South Dakota around 8:15am and made it all the way home by midnight.

Some lessons learned:

* It's possible to camp with little more than sleeping bags and pillows, and your body will learn to sleep in those conditions quickly.
* County and City campgrounds are often great, and often less booked up than State campgrounds and National Parks.
* Our compact SUV (Chevy Equinox) got shockingly good mileage (29.6 mpg) and was very comfortable for the long days of driving.
* If you get COVID on a trip, try to extend your original hotel stay, or you might end up stuck with nowhere to stay.

The one way car rental was painfully expensive, but much cheaper than ten days in a New York hotel, so off we went. We cleared out the camping supplies at a few Walmarts - a $30 kids tent and five $12 sleeping bags - and set off driving. We didn't want to stay in hotels on the way home - that was what we were trying to avoid - so we camped, two in the car and two in the little tent.
