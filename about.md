Hi, I'm Scott Louvau. I live near Seattle. I worked at Microsoft, mostly on Visual Studio and Visual Studio Online. I'm passionate about performance and I love to optimize things - code, games, finances, coffee - everything. The optimizing of finances worked out well, and now I'm off writing fast code, playing old games, and spending a lot more time with my wife and two girls.

I'd love to see a world where more of the code I run is fast and more people achieve financial independence sooner, and hopefully this blog will help with that.
