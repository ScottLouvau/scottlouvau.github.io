# Relentless Optimizer
This repo contains my Relentless Optimizer blog, hosted at https://relentlessoptimizer.com.

It's a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-built static site written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using [Typora](https://typora.io/). I'm using the [Minima 3.0 theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) but have significantly modified it (adding dark theme detection and support, for example). It's hosted on GitHub Pages but I'll move to CloudFlare Pages once my domain is old enough to migrate there.
