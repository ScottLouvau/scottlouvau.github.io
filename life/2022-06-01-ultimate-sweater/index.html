My outerwear lasts a really long time, though. As a few favorites finally wore out, I decided that I should really just get exactly what I want and get rid of the rest. With that, my quest for some perfect sweaters began.</p><h2 id=goals>Goals<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#goals>#</a></h2><p>After so many years of picking things off the sale rack, it was satisfying to think about what I really want in a sweater and what I&rsquo;ve liked in my recent favorites. Overall, my goal is to find three sweaters which are ideal for indoor use, outdoors in very mild (65-75F) temperatures, or for layering under a jacket. In addition, I want:</p><h5 id=fleece>Fleece<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fleece>#</a></h5><p>I wore soft shells everywhere for a long time, but I would get sweaty indoors if it was too warm, they made noise every time I shifted in my chair, and people would sometimes ask if I wanted to &ldquo;hang up my jacket&rdquo;. Fleece sweaters fix all of this - they are much more breathable, quiet, and normal indoor wear. Cotton feels cold when I first put it on, and gets and stays a lot wetter in rain.</p><h5 id=warm>Warm<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#warm>#</a></h5><p>Ultimately, I want my sweaters for indoor use first. My office can be 65-72F or so, so I want something which is great over a shirt in that whole range. I am usually cold, so this means a mid- to heavyweight fleece.</p><h5 id=full-zip>Full Zip<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#full-zip>#</a></h5><p>Pullovers try to pull my shirt off as I remove them. I also like being able to unzip my sweater when it&rsquo;s otherwise a bit too warm for it.</p><h5 id=no-hood>No Hood<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#no-hood>#</a></h5><p>Hoods are nice for extra outdoor warmth, but annoying against a chair or an outer layer.</p><h5 id=relaxed-fit-hip-length-long-enough-sleeves>Relaxed Fit, Hip Length, Long Enough Sleeves<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#relaxed-fit-hip-length-long-enough-sleeves>#</a></h5><p>I want a sweater that fully covers my waist and wrists. I&rsquo;ve had too many sweaters that were a bit too short and I want something that really feels the right size.</p><h5 id=durable>Durable<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#durable>#</a></h5><p>I&rsquo;m willing to spend for a nice sweater, but want it to last a decade or longer. It shouldn&rsquo;t pill or wear through too quickly.</p><h5 id=coordinated-and-fashionable>Coordinated and Fashionable<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#coordinated-and-fashionable>#</a></h5><p>I&rsquo;m too lazy to make sure my clothing colors match and my clothes aren&rsquo;t too fancy or casual for whatever I&rsquo;ll be doing. I want to pick colors that work with all of my pants and a wide variety of situations, so I can just grab any of them and go. Knit exteriors have a nice look, though they may be less durable.</p><h2 id=winners>Winners<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#winners>#</a></h2><p><a href=https://www.kuiu.com/products/base-camp-full-zip-sweater-charcoal>KUIU Base Camp Full Zip</a> | $100 | 21 oz<br>When shopping for a great backpacking mid-layer, I stumbled upon KUIU. I got the &ldquo;Base Camp&rdquo; sweater because it was on sale and it quickly became a favorite. It&rsquo;s just the right warmth, a comfortable fit, and I like the look. It pills a lot, especially on the bottoms of the sleeves, so durability is a concern. I got a &ldquo;sweater shaver&rdquo; and shaved the pills off, and it&rsquo;s looking nice again. Mine is hooded, but since I already have it, I&rsquo;m keeping it until it wears out.</p><p><a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-better-sweater-fleece-jacket/25528.html?dwvar_25528_color=STH">Patagonia Better Sweater Fleece Jacket</a> | $140 | 21 oz<br>My previous favorite was a (hooded) Better Sweater, which somehow I lost. It had the same nice knit exterior, perfect warmth, and great fit. I bought an unhooded one to replace it. I especially like that the sleeves articulate well - when I raise my arms overhead, the bottom of the sweater doesn&rsquo;t ride up much. The collar for the unhooded version feels a bit tall, but otherwise it&rsquo;s great.</p><p><a href=https://www.rei.com/product/166946/rei-co-op-hyperaxis-fleece-jacket-20-mens>REI Hyperaxis 2.0</a> | $130 | 17 oz<br>As I was trying on my candidates at REI, the Hyperaxis caught my eye, so I decided to try it on and immediately loved it. It&rsquo;s made of Polartec Power Stretch Pro, which is warmer than I expect for the weight. The Hyperaxis has a hood, but the material is thin enough I think it might sit flat out of the way. It does not have a knit face, so it looks more casual, but it might also be a lot more durable than my knit choices.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=img/sweater-composite.webp alt=sweater-composite></p><h2 id=close-contenders>Close Contenders<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#close-contenders>#</a></h2><p><a href=https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/covert-cardigan>Arc&rsquo;teryx Covert Cardigan</a> | $180<br>The Covert Cardigan is extremely similar to the Better Sweater. It has a nicer cut (particularly at the shoulders) and a trimmer but comfortable fit. The collar doesn&rsquo;t feel too tall, but the arm articulation isn&rsquo;t as good as the Better Sweater. I picked the Better Sweater instead, but it&rsquo;s close between the two.</p><p><a href=https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/kyanite-ar-jacket>Arc&rsquo;teryx Kyanite AR</a> | $160<br>The Kyanite, like the Hyperaxis, is made from Polartec Power Stretch Pro, so it doesn&rsquo;t have the nice knit look, but is likely to be much more durable. I couldn&rsquo;t find it in store to try out.</p><p><a href=https://www.kuhl.com/kuhl/mens/outerwear/interceptr-pro-fz/>Kuhl Interceptr</a> | $130<br>The Interceptr looks and feels great, but was a much slimmer fit with tight sleeves.</p><p><a href=https://www.rei.com/product/177504/rei-co-op-groundbreaker-fleece-jacket-20-mens>REI Groundbreaker 2.0</a> | $50 | 13 oz<br>The Groundbreaker has a soft, &ldquo;traditional fleece&rdquo; exterior rather than a knitted one. It seemed to catch on my inner layers more as I removed it. Since it was $35 (!!) during the REI Spring Sale, I picked one up as an &ldquo;at home only&rdquo; sweater.</p><h2 id=other-possibles>Other Possibles<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#other-possibles>#</a></h2><p><a href=https://rab.equipment/us/quest-jacket>Rab Quest Fleece Jacket</a> | $100</p><p><a href=https://www.outdoorresearch.com/us/shop-by-activity/mens-vigor-plus-fleece-jacket-283183>Outdoor Research Vigor Plus Jacket</a> | $150</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h2><p>So far, going down from about ten &ldquo;pretty good&rdquo; sweaters to three great ones has been really nice. I put three hooks next to my bed and grab the one I feel like with little thought. My frugal instincts struggled with the prices, but if they last as long as my previous sweaters, it will be cheaper than cycling through &ldquo;pretty good&rdquo; $25 Costco options which don&rsquo;t love and donate after a year or two. We&rsquo;ll see.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=img/on-wall.webp alt=on-wall></p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=/life/2022-05-04-m1-macbook-charging/><span class=title>« Previous Post</span><br><span>M1 MacBooks charge from anything!</span>
