Our four-year-old mattress quickly formed hip dents, despite every-other-week rotation. We each preferred different firmnesses and bedding warmths, too, but the ~$1,600 base price of adjustable mattresses was unappealing.</p><p>While procrastinating on that, I had a weird idea: Could I sleep better on a camping pad, if I got it &ldquo;just right&rdquo;? I&rsquo;d never slept very well on sleeping pads, but I wasn&rsquo;t sleeping well anyway, so I decided to find out.</p><p>I set up an <a href="https://www.expedusa.com/products/megamat?variant=47704145363161">Exped MegaMat</a> next to our bed. I tried to judge &ldquo;just right&rdquo; bedding and inflation, and slept a few nights on it to see if I would acclimate. I didn&rsquo;t. The warmth was a lot better, but my back still ached each morning. My Apple Watch showed lots of interruptions, and that&rsquo;s how I felt.</p><p>I decided to test inflation levels systematically. I needed an inflation level which worked on both my side and stomach. On my side, my spine can&rsquo;t be curved sideways too much. On my stomach, it can&rsquo;t be too arched or too flat.</p><p>I started at the &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; level the pad self-inflates to if left open. I tried a night on that, then added five pumps with the included hand pump each night. N+10 and N+15 were both quite good. I tested more precisely, and settled on N+11. After a rough week of testing, I had my first few nights with no aching back and much higher sleep scores (94, 95, 96). Awesome!</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t want to sleep on the floor forever. Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.expedusa.com/products/megamat?variant=47704145363161">MegaMat Long X-Wide</a> is half of queen size (77.6" x 30.3" vs. 80" x 60"). We bought two from REI on sale ($200 each), and put them side-by-side in our bedframe. Underneath, we have a layer of plywood for support, and a layer of EVA foam tiles (gym floor mats) to protect the pads from splinters and be softer if we &ldquo;bottom out&rdquo;.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=img/pads-and-layers.jpg alt="Pads and Layers"></p><p>Three months in, I never wake up with lower back pain anymore. I still need to avoid late-night carbs and get my hydration right, but I hit my first perfect sleep score on the pad.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=img/apple-sleep-score-100.jpg alt="Sleep Score 100">
<img loading=lazy src=img/apple-sleep-chart.jpg alt="Sleep Chart"></p><p>Like an adjustable mattress, we each set our own firmness. The pads are isolated enough that we don&rsquo;t feel each other moving. We can incline each side separately with foam layers underneath.</p><p>We even brought them on our last trip and replicated our home setup where we were staying. Our next camping trip should be the best we&rsquo;ve ever slept in a tent.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t know how long the pads will last, but there are no springs or thick foam to wear out. Exped has a <a href=https://www.expedusa.com/pages/warranty-and-repairs>five year warranty</a>, too. The two pads also cost only 1/4 as much as a &ldquo;base model&rdquo; adjustable mattress. We got 4" thick MegaMats, but Exped has a 6" version, too.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re struggling with bed firmness, or just want to sleep better the next time you camp, getting a nice sleeping pad and systematically testing inflation might be worth a try!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=img/separate-bedding.jpg alt="Final Bed w/Separate Bedding"></p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=/life/2026/01/13/lessons-learned-from-jellyfin-handbrake-and-h.265/><span class=title>« Previous Post</span><br><span>Lessons Learned from Jellyfin, HandBrake, and H.265</span></a></nav></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=/>Relentless Optimizer</a>, all code <a href=/LICENSE.txt>MIT License</a></span>
