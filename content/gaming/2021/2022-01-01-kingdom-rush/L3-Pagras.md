Pagras introduces the Ogre and the Shaman. Unlock the first two upgrades to Rain of Fire, Blazing Skies and Scorched Earth, before this level, to help kill these two units when needed.

Build a "kill zone" with three artillery and two supporting barracks and you can handle everything except the Ogres. Rain of Fire the two Shamans in Wave 10 and the two Ogres in Wave 11. Keep reinforcements in with your soldiers throughout.
