Unlock the first two artillery upgrades, "Concentrated Fire" (+10% damage) and "Range Finder" (+10% range) before this battle. 

You start with 220G. The artillery is better at the base of the first corner so that it hits large groups more evenly. Keep placing reinforcements with your soldiers to block larger groups.

If any monsters get through, use Rain of Fire or place reinforcements to finish them.
