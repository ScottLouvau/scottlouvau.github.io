Along my saving journey, however, I found out that the two are very different. To me, In a nutshell, &ldquo;being cheap&rdquo; means trying to spend as little as possible and &ldquo;being frugal&rdquo; means to spend as thoughtfully as possible. What do those concepts really mean?</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a more broken out comparison:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Being Cheap</strong></th><th><strong>Being Frugal</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Don&rsquo;t buy anything you don&rsquo;t have to.</td><td>Don&rsquo;t buy anything you won&rsquo;t appreciate.</td></tr><tr><td>Buy the cheapest version of everything.</td><td>Buy the best value that solves the problem.</td></tr><tr><td>Keep until you&rsquo;re forced to replace.</td><td>Maintain things so they last.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Ok, so how are these ideas different?</p><h3 id=dont-buy-anything>Don&rsquo;t Buy Anything…<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dont-buy-anything>#</a></h3><p>Let&rsquo;s take groceries, for example. If I want to be cheap, I make a list of meals for the week and groceries to buy, and I only buy the things on the list. It&rsquo;s definitely the cheapest way for us to eat. We miss out on things doing this, though. Maybe ground beef is on sale, and I know we will use it even though it&rsquo;s not on the list for this week. Or I see that Rainier cherries are out this week and look good, and I know my family loves them.</p><p>If I&rsquo;m feeling frugal, instead of asking whether something is on the list of needs, I ask whether we would appreciate it. I know we like Rainier cherries, so I&rsquo;ll get them. I won&rsquo;t get three different kinds of fruit, however, because I know we won&rsquo;t get through them before they spoil.</p><h3 id=buy-the-cheapest>Buy the Cheapest…<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#buy-the-cheapest>#</a></h3><p>Continuing the grocery example, when I&rsquo;m feeling cheap I&rsquo;ll stick to the cheapest version of everything I can find. Red cherries are cheaper than Rainiers, so I&rsquo;ll stick with them (if I get fruit at all). The store brand milk and bread will be fine.</p><p>When I&rsquo;m feeling frugal, I am willing to spend more if I know I appreciate the difference. My family really does love the Rainier cherries a lot more. I will still get grapes instead of cherries if the grapes are a much better deal this week, because I know my family will enjoy either of them. I think the Franz breads are worth paying more for, though I don&rsquo;t think the brand milks taste any different from the store brand.</p><p>Shifting to another example, I tend to buy midrange smartphones. It&rsquo;s possible to buy a smartphone for $150, but I know I appreciate a high quality screen, top-tier performance, and wireless charging, and I use my phone every day. When security updates stopped for my Pixel 2, I looked around and found that the $700 Galaxy S20 FE ticked the right feature boxes. It wasn&rsquo;t a cheap choice, certainly, but I knew I&rsquo;d appreciate the extra speed and features over the $500 Pixel 4a 5G. On the other hand, there was little difference between the FE and the $1,200 S20+. I&rsquo;m looking for that &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; that solves the problem I want solved at the best price.</p><h3 id=keep-until>Keep Until…<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#keep-until>#</a></h3><p>Whether I&rsquo;m feeling frugal or cheap, I want my things to last. I get a case and screen protector for my phone. I keep my car maintained. The difference is that if I&rsquo;m feeling cheap, I&rsquo;ll try not to replace something until it&rsquo;s absolutely used up. I could&rsquo;ve kept my Pixel 2, for example, until it wouldn&rsquo;t hold a charge. If I&rsquo;m feeling frugal, I&rsquo;m open to replacing something if a replacement will be a lot better, but I still maintain my things so that I&rsquo;m not forced to replace them before that. I&rsquo;m also willing to attempt a repair even for an old item if I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d really appreciate a replacement. Earlier this year the a heating element in our oven failed, and though the oven is at least 15 years old, we decided to try getting a replacement element first, and we successfully fixed the problem for $35.</p><h3 id=whats-the-point>What&rsquo;s the Point?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#whats-the-point>#</a></h3><p>To summarize, to me being cheap means not spending money unless I need to, and being frugal means not spending money unless I&rsquo;ll appreciate what I get for it. In both cases I&rsquo;m being mindful of my spending and trying not to waste money. The difference in mindset is really important to me, however.</p><p>When I&rsquo;m being cheap, I sometimes feel like I&rsquo;m just scraping by and I can&rsquo;t have anything that I merely want. I feel like I don&rsquo;t have &ldquo;enough&rdquo;, no matter how much money I&rsquo;m saving every month. In contrast, when I&rsquo;m being frugal I feel a lot better. I don&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s anything I can&rsquo;t have, only things I don&rsquo;t get that aren&rsquo;t really worth getting. At the same time, I also feel good that I&rsquo;m not wasting what I have, and I&rsquo;m making progress toward my longer term goals by saving.</p><p>Of course, I feel lucky that I can choose to spend more on living frugally. Many people can&rsquo;t afford more than their needs every month, and they&rsquo;re stuck in a difficult place until they can find more income or lower core expenses. I&rsquo;m sure it feels much more painful than the &ldquo;not having enough&rdquo; I stumbled into voluntarily.</p><p>If you do have the choice, striking the right balance ideally means progress toward long term freedom without feeling like you don&rsquo;t have enough along the way. If you&rsquo;re feeling regret about not saving enough for the future, or feeling like you don&rsquo;t have enough now, it&rsquo;s a good hint to consider adjusting your balance in making spending choices.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=/finance/2021/08/19/frugal-groceries/><span class=title>« Previous Post</span><br><span>Frugal Groceries</span></a>
