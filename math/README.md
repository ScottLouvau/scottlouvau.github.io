"2.OA.B.2
Fluently add and subtract within 20 using mental strategies. By end of Grade 2,
know from memory **all sums of two one-digit numbers**."

"3.OA.C.7 
Fluently multiply and divide within 100, using strategies such as the relationship
between multiplication and division (e.g., knowing that 8 ร 5 = 40, one knows 40
รท 5 = 8) or properties of operations. By the end of Grade 3, know from memory
**all products of two one-digit numbers.**"

-> WA Math Goals are for one digit numbers (0-9). Only addition and multiplication seem to be listed as memorized facts.
