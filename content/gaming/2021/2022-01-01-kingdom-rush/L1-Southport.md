One artillery tower and two barracks can usually hold off all waves with no reinforcements, rain of fire, or hero involvement, and no upgrades active.

Consider building a mage tower below the artillery to handle any monsters who get through.

Finish Heroic mode right after the basic level for another upgrade star. You'll use the same layout, but can only afford the artillery initially. Add the two barracks once you can afford them, using reinforcements in the meantime. Use your Rain of Fire if the Orcs break through your defenses. Add a second artillery tower under the first one and a barracks behind it for the final wave.

Finish Iron mode immediately as well. Unlock the first upgrade for Artillery and Soldiers. In this version, you'll want just the top barracks and two artillery underneath. Use reinforcements constantly with your soldiers and Rain of Fire if some enemies get through. Build additional artillery below the kill zone when you have enough money, and use a Rain of Fire on the huge group at the end just after they've broken through your kill zone.
